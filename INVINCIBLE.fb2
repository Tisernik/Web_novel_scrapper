				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3554 – Kai Dong’s Strength&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “What?!” The experts of the Creation Palace were shocked. </p>
			<p> “Do you think that Huang Xiaolong…” Someone asked. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Kai Dong’s eyes. He muttered softly, “We cannot be sure if Huang Xiaolong had anything to do with this. The only thing we know is that Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu ran into trouble.” </p>
			<p> The experts from the Creation Palace looked at each other doubtfully. </p>
			<p> “Is that really possible? Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu are Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage! Those they brought along are in the grand completion stage at the very least, and there are more than twenty of them! Even if the Star Dragon Couple launched a surprise attack, some of them would be able to get away!” </p>
			<p> Kai Dong was similarly confused, but he tried to suppress his shock the best he could. </p>
			<p> Even if he were to catch Ao Wanshan and the others by surprise, he wouldn’t be able to wipe them out with a trace! </p>
			<p> “Did Chen Yizhen, Lin Tong, and the entire Eternal Heaven Alliance lay down a trap for them?” Someone guessed. </p>
			<p> “There are no other explanations!”  </p>
			<p> “Experts from the Eternal Heaven Alliance? Did Tao Shi lie to us?!” </p>
			<p> The experts from the Creation Palace started to throw random guesses around. </p>
			<p> A frosty light flashed through Kai Dong’s eyes and he growled, “Tao Shi!” </p>
			<p> Evidently, he was slowly leaning towards Tao Shi’s betrayal. After all, the Eternal Heaven Alliance and the Creation Palace had never been on good terms. It was very likely for them to set a trap on such a large scale in order to eradicate a huge part of the other side’s strength. </p>
			<p> Even though that was the case, a trace of doubt remained in Kai Dong’s mind. He didn’t think that the Eternal Heaven Alliance was crazy enough to wage war on the Creation Palace! </p>
			<p> “Palace Master, should we leave?” </p>
			<p> Kai Dong hesitated for a second before muttering uncertainty, “Alright.” </p>
			<p> He felt that something was extremely off with the space they were in and decided to pull back to Kun Feng’s side before deciding on their next course of action. </p>
			<p> A cold sneer rang through the skies before they could escape. “Since you’re already here, don’t bother leaving!” </p>
			<p> Kai Dong and the experts of the Creation Palace turned to stare at the source of the voice, and a figure descended from the void. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?!” Kai Dong swept his gaze across the surrounding space like Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu when they first met him. </p>
			<p> “You were right. Tao Shi baited all of you over. The experts of my Eternal Heaven Alliance are hiding in ambush all around you!” Huang Xiaolong sneered. </p>
			<p> “Indeed!” One of the experts from the Creation Palace raged. All of them crushed their transmission symbol to alert Kun Feng about Tao Shi’s act of betrayal. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with them and he activated the grand formation he laid down earlier. A screen of light appeared to trap Kai Dong and the rest. </p>
			<p> He was obviously messing with Kai Dong. He wanted them to alert Kun Feng in hopes of misleading the members of the Creation Palace. When that happened, Kai Dong’s disappearance would be linked to the Eternal Heaven Alliance! </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong might look like they were siding with Huang Xiaolong, but he was sure that they were working against him in the dark. After all, they sent him to the Solitary Alliance alone to attend the ceremony. They were clearly giving the Creation Palace a chance to deal with him! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be more certain of Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong’s intentions. When the Creation Palace killed him, the Star Dragon Couple, Pangu, and the others would definitely go crazy to take revenge. When they killed their way into the Creation Palace and suffered serious losses, Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong would take the chance to kill everyone, turning into the biggest fishermen in the First Universe! </p>
			<p> Since they placed him in the same group as Tao Shi, it showed how deep their plot went. As leaders of the Eternal Heaven Alliance, they would be utter failures if they couldn’t tell the grudge between the two! They were planning to use Tao Shi to get rid of Huang Xiaolong once and for all! </p>
			<p> They started it, and Huang Xiaolong simply returned the favor. </p>
			<p> Slowly approaching the experts of the Creation Palace, a grin formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> Kai Dong’s cautious expression turned into one of confusion. Huang Xiaolong was clearly the only person in the grand formation! There was no ambush to speak of! </p>
			<p> “You did that on purpose!” Kai Dong growled all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Creation Palace stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> “Yup.” Huang Xiaolong nodded nonchalantly. </p>
			<p> “What’s the point of doing that?” Kai Dong frowned. He had no idea what Huang Xiaolong was planning. </p>
			<p> Even if they were set up, all they had to do was to shatter the formation and escape. The false information Huang Xiaolong wanted Kun Feng to learn would turn useless the moment they escaped. </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that I only possess 3.7 billion units of grand cosmos energy?” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> “You… Are you not at the large completion stage?! Are you a half step Universe God like me?!” Kai Dong gasped. </p>
			<p> “No. I’m most definitely at the large completion stage.” </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, stop with your bullsh*t!” Someone from the Creation Palace snapped. “I’ll cripple you right now!” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, a punch flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> Even with the grand formation operating at full power, purple lightning bolts exploded under the power of the strike. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong released his grand cosmos energy completely and returned the attack with a punch of his own.  </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> When their blows landed, the expert from the Creation Palace felt his hand shattering into pieces. The might of an existence who surpassed the half step Universe God level crashed directly into him. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> He crashed into the barrier of light and he felt every single organ in his body shattering into countless pieces. </p>
			<p> Kai Dong and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong with their eyes wide. They couldn’t conceal the shock in their hearts. </p>
			<p> “You!” Kai Dong roared. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds! 𝑓𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝒷𝑛𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p> Strolling casually towards Kai Dong and the rest, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I’ll give you a chance. If you choose to submit to me, I’ll let this go.” </p>
			<p> A snort left Kai Dong’s lips. “Huang Xiaolong, so what if you have three great worlds? Even with more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, I’m a half step Universe God. Do you really think that you can trap me here?! Haha, my strength isn’t something you can imagine!” </p>
			<p> Instead of retreating, he took the initiative to approach Huang Xiaolong. “Now, I’ll show you the difference between a God of Creation at the large completion stage and a half step Universe God!” Releasing his arua, the grand formation trembled incessantly. It seemed to be ready to break apart at any moment. </p>
			<p> Kai Dong grabbed at the void before him, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though the universe was bending to Kai Dong’s will.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3555 – Huang Xiaolong, You Dare?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The laws of the universe gathered around Kai Dong. When that happened, Huang Xiaolong felt that his three great worlds were slowing down. </p>
			<p> To his surprise, he felt extremely restricted by the universe laws! He could only use NINETY percent of his original power! </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, what do you think?! Do you feel suppressed?” Kai Dong roared with laughter as he approached Huang Xiaolong. A burning gaze could be seen in his eyes as he continued, “Three great worlds… Huang Xiaolong, you surprise me time and time again.” </p>
			<p> A jade-blue spike appeared in his hands as he spoke. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> “This is a top-grade creation artifact I nurtured all these years. It hasn’t seen blood in many years!” Kai Dong sneered. “It can pierce through anything in the thirteen universes!” </p>
			<p> Stabbing straight towards Huang Xiaolong’s glabella. </p>
			<p> If it connected, Huang Xiaolong’s dao soul would be completely destroyed! </p>
			<p> Before what Kai Dong anticipated could happen, a giant tree appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. Starlight fell from the crown of the tree, and the universe shifted. The purple lightning that filled the grand formation was completely covered up.  </p>
			<p> He fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the spike landed on the trunk instead of his head. </p>
			<p> “Thunk.” </p>
			<p> A frightening amount of starlight was released from the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> Kai Dong felt a sharp pain shooting up his arm, and he realized that he only managed to cut off a tiny piece of bark. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle as he commenced his retaliation instantaneously. The roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree swept at Kai Dong and they sent him flying. He tried his best to dodge, but there were too many roots to take care of! </p>
			<p> By the time he stabilized himself, perspiration drenched his armor. </p>
			<p> “Star Dragon Divine Tree!” The experts of the Creation Palace yelled in unison. </p>
			<p> Kai Dong felt his head going numb when he stared at the massive tree standing before him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong actually managed to obtain the Star Dragon Divine Tree! 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p> If the Universe Boat didn’t appear, nothing would be able to suppress the Star Dragon Divine Tree! </p>
			<p> His initial confidence to suppress Huang Xiaolong turned to dust instantly as despair filled his heart. </p>
			<p> Layers upon layers of starlight emerged from the Star Dragon Divine Tree to engulf the space they were in. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Half a day later, Tao Shi frowned as he asked one of the experts beside him, “Did the Creation Palace say anything?!” </p>
			<p> “Not yet…” Qian Shaolin sighed. “Do you think that they changed their mind? Did Kai Dong not make a move on Huang Xiaolong?” </p>
			<p> “This is the best chance they have to get rid of him! They won’t give it up no matter what happens.” Tao Shi shook his head. “I’m afraid that an accident might have occured.” </p>
			<p> Feng Tianquan chuckled in response, “What accident can there be? There is no way Kai Dong, Ao Wanshan, and Wang Zaixu can lose to Huang Xiaolong! Kai Dong is a half step Universe God! It won’t be easy for anyone to deal with him!” </p>
			<p> Tao Shi nodded slowly. </p>
			<p> Another hour passed but everything remained quiet. </p>
			<p> “This won’t do. We have to head over to take a look.” Tao Shi snapped. </p>
			<p> Nodding in acknowledgement, Qian Shaolin growled, “Alright, we’ll go together.” </p>
			<p> The experts of the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s fourth team returned to the Tight Stone Forest to check up on the outcome of the battle. </p>
			<p> By the time they returned, they noticed that the area was eerily quiet. There were no signs of battle! </p>
			<p> The silence caused Tao Shi’s heart to palpitate. </p>
			<p> Looking at each other in silence, everyone felt uneasy. </p>
			<p> “Did Kai Dong really change his mind?” Feng Tianquan frowned. “It’s too quiet! Not a sign of battle can be seen!” </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong might have already cleaned up the battlefield…” Qian Shaolin guessed. </p>
			<p> His words were met with ridicule from Feng Tianquan. “Lord Qian, Huang Xiaolong cannot possibly bring along three half step Universe Gods with him. With Kai Dong, Ao Wanshan, and Wang Zaixu, they would be able to hold their own even against three half step Universe Gods! There’s no need to question their abilities!” </p>
			<p> “Let’s enter.” Tao Shi suddenly suggested. However, they were greeted by Huang Xiaolong’s party before they could enter the Tight Stone Forest. </p>
			<p> Tao Shi and the others stared in shock as Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards them unscathed. </p>
			<p> Was Feng Tianquan right? Did the Creation Palace change their mind?! </p>
			<p> “Did… Did nothing happen?!” Tao Shi couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> “Of course not? Are all of you feeling unwell? Your complexion looks pretty bad…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> “We ran into a group of wild beasts earlier… We’re fine now.” </p>
			<p> “That’s good to hear.” Huang Xiaolong nearly failed to contain his laughter. </p>
			<p> As such, the entire group from the Eternal Heaven Alliance continued on their way. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Tao Shi’s transmission symbol to tremble. It was a message from an expert from the Creation Palace! </p>
			<p> After reading the report, Tao Shi’s expression changed. He felt a chill running down his spine. In the message, it was said that Kai Dong’s group of sixteen lost all contact with the Creation Palace. They were questioning Tao Shi on the disappearance! </p>
			<p> Since the Creation Palace could say something like that, there was no mistake about it! Kai Dong definitely made a move!  </p>
			<p> This… </p>
			<p> Tao Shi looked at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye, and he felt goosebumps all over his body. </p>
			<p> If their disappearance had something to do with Huang Xiaolong, they were in deep sh*t! He felt as though he was looking at the most terrifying beast hidden in human skin at that moment. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong caught the look of terror in Tao Shi’s eye and a smile formed on his face. “Fellow cultivator Tao Shi, is there something wrong?” </p>
			<p> Shaking his head violently, Tao Shi stuttered, “No… Nothing’s wrong!” </p>
			<p> Qian Shaolin signaled to Tao Shi with his eyes, and Tao Shi quickly passed the transmission symbol over. Like Tao Shi, Qian Shaolin felt his limbs going cold. </p>
			<p> Ignoring the two of them, Huang Xiaolong stopped suddenly as he stared in a certain direction in shock. Just a second ago, he felt a reaction from the universe sphere! It might not be too strong, but there was definitely something! </p>
			<p> There was only one explanation. The universe sphere felt the existence of the cosmos sphere! </p>
			<p> No longer bothering with Tao Shi and the rest, Huang Xiaolong shot through the air in the direction of the calling. Wang Meiqi and the others followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> When Feng Tianquan saw Huang Xiaolong leaving the group, he roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you leave the group without Lord Tao Shi’s order?!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3556 – Garbage Rules&lt;/h4&gt; 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			</title>
			<p> Feng Tianquan didn’t see the message from the Creation Palace, and he didn’t know that Kai Dong and fifteen other experts had gone missing. </p>
			<p> When Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin heard him, they roared at him in shock, “Shut up!” </p>
			<p> They panicked and failed to suppress their voice. The soundwave that erupted scared Feng Tianquan and the rest. </p>
			<p> With his mouth agape, Feng Tianquan looked at the two of them with a wronged expression on his face. </p>
			<p> Casually turning to glance at Feng Tianquan, Huang Xiaolong decided against taking action as the allure of the cosmos sphere was too d*mn great! He continued to fly in the direction of the treasure. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from the sights of the group. </p>
			<p> Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had left, Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> “Lord Tao Shi, this…” Feng Tianquan couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> Hesitating for a moment, Tao Shi eventually decided to show Feng Tianquan the message from the Creation Palace. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t someone you can afford to offend. In the future, steer clear of him.”  </p>
			<p> Feng Tianquan snorted in contempt when he scanned through the message. “Lord Tao Shi, are you seriously going to believe that Huang Xiaolong has three half step Universe Gods protecting him?” </p>
			<p> Tao Shi’s expression sank when he saw that Feng Tianquan was still taking it as a joke. “If you anger Huang Xiaolong in the future, you better not blame me for not backing you up!” </p>
			<p> Tao Shi left no room for arguments. </p>
			<p> After all, if Feng Tianquan were to offend Huang Xiaolong, Tao Shi would be dragged into it regardless. </p>
			<p> Feng Tianquan’s face finally changed. </p>
			<p> “Lord Tao Shi, Huang Xiaolong… Should we follow him?” Qian Shaolin asked. </p>
			<p> Read the most updated version of this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Tao Shi decided after a short moment of contemplation. He flew in the direction Huang Xiaolong left without bothering with Feng Tianquan. </p>
			<p> With his expression ugly to the extreme, Feng Tianquan’s hatred for Huang Xiaolong grew even stronger. In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong was the reason he was humiliated by Tao Shi. When he thought about the look in Wang Meiqi’s eyes when she looked at him, rage filled his heart. </p>
			<p> ‘Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? The only reason behind your arrogance is the Star Dragon Couple! Humph. You’re just a God of Creation at the large completion stage. You’re not fit to stay by Wang Meiqi’s side!’ Feng Tianquan growled in his mind as he followed behind Tao Shi. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s group soared through the air and they passed mountain ranges after mountain ranges in an instant. Wang Meiqi and the rest were curious about his intentions, but they could only follow silently behind. </p>
			<p> After flying for half an hour, Huang Xiaolong stopped above a patch of barren land. Descending slowly, he walked slowly in a certain direction. The three of them saw a piece of golden scale emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s body and a look of excitement formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> Wang Meiqi and the rest were shocked. They don’t recall Huang Xiaolong ever looking so elated. What in the world was going on? </p>
			<p> Tao Shi and the rest had arrived, and they were equally as stunned to see the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Their gazes slowly went to the golden scale hovering in the air before him. </p>
			<p> When they saw the runes on the scale, Tao Shi felt a bolt of lightning running through his mind. Was that… </p>
			<p> He rushed towards the golden scale without a care in the world. It was as though Huang Xiaolong didn’t exist! </p>
			<p> It was too bad he was sent back by a terrifying blast of energy. Tao Shi stared at Ao Shenghai in shock. </p>
			<p> “Lord Tao Shi!” Qian Shaolin and the rest surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly. </p>
			<p> Sucking in a cold breath, Tao Shi spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, as long as you are willing to give me the scale, I’ll agree to any request you have!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned around and looked at Tao Shi like the other party was a clown. “I found this treasure by myself. Who do you think you are to ask me to hand it over?” </p>
			<p> Since he located the cosmos sphere, there was no longer a point in hiding his strength. </p>
			<p> When an expert behind Tao Shi heard what Huang Xiaolong said, he roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far! How dare you speak to Lord Tao Shi in this manner?!” </p>
			<p> Feng Tianquan couldn’t give up such a good opportunity to clash with Huang Xiaolong and he sneered in disgust, “Huang Xiaolong, kneel and apologize to Lord Tao Shi immediately!” </p>
			<p> “Kneel to apologize?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually before grabbing Feng Tianquan through the void. He grabbed the man by the neck, and he squeezed down tightly. Feng Tianquan’s eyes bulged as sounds of bone snapping came from his neck. </p>
			<p> Everyone gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin frowned as they didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so strong. </p>
			<p> From their estimations, Huang Xiaolong probably had several mysterious experts protecting him in the dark. They didn’t think that he would be strong enough to deal with an expert at Feng Tianquan’s level by himself. </p>
			<p> After all, Feng Tianquan was at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. He was but a mere chicken in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. If that was the case, wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong was at the peak of the grand completion stage?! Even if he wasn’t, he definitely had more than 8 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> Failing around in rage and confusion, Feng Tianquan didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so strong! He tried to compose himself as he roared with rage, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you move against me before Lord Tao Shi?! Are you ignoring the rules of the alliance?! Release me immediately!” </p>
			<p> He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would go too far. </p>
			<p> “Rules of the alliance?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Those rules don’t mean a thing to me.”  </p>
			<p> A surge of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s arms the next instant and he crushed Feng Tianquan’s neck. “I didn’t bother arguing with you all these years because of Wang Meiqi. Oh, another reason behind my nonchalance was because you’re nothing but an annoying piece of sh*t that isn’t worth my attention. Do you really think that I’m afraid of you?” </p>
			<p> He turned the rest of Feng Tianquan’s head into a puddle of blood after he spoke. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong!” A God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage yelled as he tried to stop Huang Xiaolong. However, Tao Shi held him back. </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong was done crushing Feng Tianquan’s physical body, he tossed his dao soul into the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> There was a reason a God of Creation was said to be immortal. They shared the same lifespan as the universe, but nothing was absolute. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, exterminating the physical body of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage was nothing. </p>
			<p> “You… You’re definitely at the large completion stage! How can you…” Tao Shi stuttered. Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong revealed his true strength. </p>
			<p> 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy emerged from his body instantly as it filled the space around them. Tao Shi and the others were sent tumbling backwards. </p>
			<p> When they finally stabilized themselves, Tao Shi realized something extremely important! He knew how Kai Dong disappeared, and he knew why there weren't any signs of battle! Huang Xiaolong was too freaking strong! He dealt with them quickly and cleaned up the battlefield before the members of the Eternal Heaven Alliance arrived! </p>
			<p> There had never been any hidden experts around Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> He was the one who resolved all the problems that came his way!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3557 – Natural?&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> If Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin were unable to resist the mere shockwave from the revelation of Huang Xiaolong’s power, there was no need to mention the others. They were on their knees as all the air was knocked out from their lungs. </p>
			<p> “Run!” Someone among them yelled all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> He was the God of Creation who wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong when he destroyed Feng Tianquan’s physical body earlier. However, he barely turned around when he saw more than a dozen people appearing in the skies around them. </p>
			<p> All of them were experts from the Creation Palace and the Hundred Empire Alliance! </p>
			<p> “Zhu Yaowen!” </p>
			<p> “Yang Gang!” </p>
			<p> “Wang Zaixu!” </p>
			<p> Tao Shi and the others felt something clicking in their mind. “Did all of you…” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! His Highness has already accepted us into his service!” Zhu Yaowen smiled. 𝒻𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝑛ℴ𝘷𝑒𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚 </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong captured all of them, he laid down the Star Dragon Brand in their dao souls. Other than Kai Dong who was a half step Universe God and had higher resistance, all of them were already his servants! </p>
			<p> There were seventy Gods of Creation standing around Huang Xiaolong, and a large portion of them were in the grand completion stage! There were even two at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> Tao Shi and the others felt despair clouding their hearts when they saw the luxurious lineup. </p>
			<p> “You can choose to submit, or I can destroy your physical body like Feng Tianquan!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice boomed in their ears. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you betray the alliance leaders! We won’t submit!” Someone screamed in anger. </p>
			<p> Waving his hand casually, the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared and beams of starlight struck the expert who spoke. Tao Shi, Qian Shaolin, and the others saw him flying through the air before landing on the ground as a puddle of blood. </p>
			<p> “Star Dragon Divine Tree!” Tao Shi gasped. </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before releasing a light barrier to trap everyone around him. </p>
			<p> By the time they reacted, the entire region was covered in starlight. It was as though they had been transported to another world. </p>
			<p> Tao Shi tried to release his dao souls, but they were forcefully suppressed. </p>
			<p> “In my Star Dragon Space, not even half step Universe Gods will be able to escape in a short amount of time.” Huang Xiaolong took a step towards Tao Shi. “As for people like you… You won’t be able to break through the barrier even if I gave you an eternity.” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> In one of the cultivation caves in the Unknown Space, Kun Feng, Xuan Hong, and the experts of the Creation Palace finally blasted away the final layer of restrictions. As it turned out, the cave was left behind by an expert at the half step Universe God realm! There were countless treasures within, and there were even five high-level universe spiritual veins! The experts of the Creation Palace nearly jumped in joy from their discovery. </p>
			<p> However, Kun Feng and Xuan Hong found it hard to celebrate. </p>
			<p> Countless days had passed, and Kai Dong failed to contact them. </p>
			<p> “I’m afraid something happened to second brother…” Xuan Hong’s expression was solemn as he growled, “The last thing he said was that they ran into a trap laid down by the Eternal Heaven Alliance!” </p>
			<p> Kun Feng gnashed his teeth and he swore, “We’ll make a trip over to the Eternal Heaven Alliance and ask them ourselves! Get someone to look into Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong’s whereabouts! I’ll go there right now!” </p>
			<p> “If they refuse to hand second brother over…” </p>
			<p> “We’ll kill them all!”  </p>
			<p> Several moments later, the experts of the Creation Palace charged out of the cultivation cave together. </p>
			<p> As for Huang Xiaolong and the others, they arrived at one of the mountain ranges in the Unknown Space. </p>
			<p> “Alright. Let’s do it here.” Huang Xiaolong declared. </p>
			<p> He decided to refine Ao Wanshan’s Huang Long Bloodline as soon as he could. He would try to comprehend the cosmos sphere at the same time as he tried fusing both treasures to form the Universe Sphere! </p>
			<p> As long as that happened, he would be able to locate the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Laying down countless formations around him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless. They were in the most mysterious place in the thirteen universes, and Huang Xiaolong only stopped after laying down dozens of formations. </p>
			<p> Ao Shenhai and the others were sent to guard the area. </p>
			<p> Since Tao Shi and the others had already submitted to Huang Xiaolong, his ‘army’ increased to over two hundred Gods of Creation! With their combined strength, they wouldn’t be afraid of three half step Universe Gods even if they came knocking! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong hovered in the air above the mountain range and he released Ao Wanshan. Turning into the Star Dragon Divine Tree, countless roots pierced the man’s body! He started to devour Ao Wanshan’s bloodline and grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, I won’t let you off even in death!” Ao Wanshan screamed frantically. </p>
			<p> Regardless of how hard he struggled, he was devoured by Huang Xiaolong till nothing was left. </p>
			<p> When he was done, Huang Xiaolong sealed Ao Wanshan’s dao soul in the depths of the Sun Moon Furnace. Retrieving the cosmos sphere, he started to comprehend the mysteries of the universe contained within. </p>
			<p> Just like that, millions of years passed. </p>
			<p> When he was finally done, the two spheres fused to form a giant orb. The Universe Orb hovered before Huang Xiaolong and emitted dazzling rays of light. The runes that lined the orb were like tiny little veins. When they lit up, Huang Xiaolong felt as though the universe was palpitating. The Universe Orb seemed to possess a life of its own. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong tried to locate the Universe Boat with the Universe Orb, and a ray of light shot towards the depths of the Unknown Space. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. </p>
			<p> Was the Universe Boat in the depths of the Unknown Space? </p>
			<p> Without bothering upgrading the Purple Lightning Peak, Huang Xiaolong charged in the direction of the light. </p>
			<p> “Your Highness!” Wang Meiqi and the rest welcomed him the moment he emerged.  </p>
			<p> “Release the formations! We’re leaving!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t say too much as he charged in a specific direction. The entire group followed quickly behind. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Huang Xiaolong’s group ran into hordes of beast waves. However, he personally dealt with them in order to save some time. </p>
			<p> Several months later, Huang Xiaolong realized that they were still extremely far away from their destination. </p>

			<p> Even after half a year of flying, they didn’t reach the depths of the Unknown Space. </p>
			<p> The restrictions were growing stronger and stronger, and they formed a giant screen that had terrifying suppressive powers. Not even Huang Xiaolong could pass through easily. </p>
			<p> After a year, Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to stop. </p>
			<p> The consumption of grand cosmos energy grew too large even for Huang Xiaolong. </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3558 – We’ll Be Too Late&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The depths of the Unknown Lands was a mystery! </p>
			<p> No one had ever gone to the end of the Unknown Space, not even half step Universe Gods! Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect to be unable to break through the restrictions with 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> He could only turn back. </p>
			<p> After meeting Wang Meiqi and the rest, he didn’t choose to remain in the Unknown Lands. They departed immediately. </p>
			<p> Two years later, they finally left the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> Looking at the vast space before them, Huang Xiaolong spoke to Tao Shi, “Go investigate the situation in the Creation Palace and the Eternal Heaven Alliance.” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Your Highness!” Tao Shi nodded before passing the order down. </p>
			<p> Even though Tao Shi and the others were from the Eternal Heaven Alliance, they had celestial empires of their own. Their subordinates were all over the place! It didn’t take long for them to receive reports on the two superpowers. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was cultivating, everyone who went to the Unknown Lands eventually left.  </p>
			<p> The Creation Palace waged war on the Eternal Heaven Alliance because of the matter regarding Kai Dong, and more than a dozen battles broke out among the two superpowers. Both sides suffered considerable losses. </p>
			<p> No one knew when, but the Eternal Heaven Alliance and the Creation Palace were showing sighs of reconciliation. </p>
			<p> “Oh? What’s with the sudden change in attitude?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Wasn’t the Eternal Heaven Alliance created to oppose the Creation Palace? Why the sudden change of heart? </p>
			<p> “Do you know what their recent meetings were about?” </p>
			<p> “No. Not even the higher-ups of the organizations knew what Kun Feng, Xuan Hong, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong spoke about.” Tao Shi shook his head and sighed. </p>
			<p> “What about Mei Jie?” Huang Xiaolong thought of another problem. </p>
			<p> “We heard that Mei Jie hasn’t emerged from the Unknown Lands. There are some who say that he is trapped in a dangerous region, and there are others who say that he managed to enter the depths of the Unknown Space. Also…” Tao Shi paused all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> “Speak.” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> “There are some who said that Mei Jie managed to obtain the cosmos sphere. He might be hiding somewhere in the Unknown Space to comprehend the universe laws contained within.” </p>
			<p> Read this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at the &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> That wasn’t possible. Huang Xiaolong already combined both treasures to form the Universe Sphere. </p>
			<p> With question marks floating in his mind, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t understand what happened. Did Mei Jie go missing? </p>
			<p> There was no way for him to be trapped in the Unknown Space with the strength he possessed. The only other possibility was that he managed to enter the depths of the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> What could possibly be held in there to hold him back for millions of years? </p>
			<p> From what Huang Xiaolong discovered, the Universe Boat was located there. That was all he knew for now. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, with Mei Jie gone, Huang Xiaolong was the strongest existence in the thirteen universes! There was no one capable of challenging him! </p>
			<p> “Your Highness, where do we go now?” Wang Meiqi asked. </p>
			<p> Naturally, they were unable to return to the Eternal Heaven Alliance with all the ruckus they kicked up. </p>
			<p> “We’ll go to the Hundred Empire Alliance!” Huang Xiaolong decided after a short while. </p>
			<p> Out of all the superpowers in the First Universe, the Hundred Empire Alliance was the easiest to take over! </p>
			<p> The Creation Palace lost Kai Dong, Ao Ying, and dozens of other experts. Less than three hundred Gods of Creation were left in the Creation Palace, and there were only a few of them at the peak of the grand completion stage.  </p>
			<p> If Huang Xiaolong could swallow the Hundred Empire Alliance and several other smaller powers, he could suppress the Creation Palace completely! </p>
			<p> However, if the Creation Palace were to fix their relationship with the Eternal Heaven Alliance, things might get slightly more troublesome. </p>
			<p> Without further delay, Huang Xiaolong charged towards the Hundred Empire Alliance. </p>
			<p> Using a high-grade creation artifact-level flying ship he obtained, they flew straight towards their headquarters. </p>
			<p> Half a month later, they arrived. However, they were met with an interesting scene on their arrival. Several dozen figures were chasing down a small group. </p>
			<p> “Elder Hu, protect the young lady! We’ll hold them off!” Someone yelled. </p>
			<p> “No! Elder Man, you protect the young lady! I’ll stop them!” </p>
			<p> “Bullsh*t! None of you Solitary Alliance weaklings are getting away!” </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong heard the name ‘Solitary Alliance’, his heart fluttered slightly. He released his dao souls to check on what was happening. </p>
			<p> More than thirty experts surrounded the members of the Solitary Alliance who numbered slightly more than ten. Jiang Shaoyu was protected by several men, and she glared at her assailants angrily. </p>
			<p> “Jiang Shaoyu, stop trying to escape. Even if you manage to leave, you won’t be able to hide for long! The First Universe will belong to our Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance soon!” Jiang Qiuping, a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, roared with laughter. He was someone from the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> The expressions of those from the Solitary Alliance were extremely ugly. </p>
			<p> “Even if I die, I won’t give in to you b*stards!” Jiang Shaoyu sneered. </p>
			<p> “Die? Do you really think that I’ll give you the chance to die? If you refuse to surrender, I’ll make your life a living hell!” Jiang Qiuping snorted in contempt. </p>
			<p> “Kill them!” Someone from the Solitary Alliance roared. “We’ll kill our way out and bring the young lady away!” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, he charged towards the nearest expert from the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> “Since you’re tired of living, I’ll grant your wish!” Jiang Qiuping’s expression fell and he closed in on Jiang Shaoyu. “Kill them!” </p>
			<p> He tried to grab her, but his plan was foiled by someone from the Solitary Alliance. In a fit of rage, he sent the other party flying. </p>
			<p> Jiang Qiuping didn’t give up on his attempt to capture her. </p>
			<p> As the blood drained from her face, she watched as Jiang Qiuping’s palm grew larger and larger. Before it could land on her chest, a snort came from the void and golden dragons emerged from the space above Jiang Qiuping. Panicking, Jiang Qiuping redirected his palm to stop the sneak attack. </p>
			<p> Boom!  </p>
			<p> As he was sent tumbling through the air, his arms exploded into a mist of blood. </p>
			<p> Everyone stopped abruptly due to the sudden change in situation. When they discovered that there was another group of experts slowly flying towards them, everyone was shocked. Huang Xiaolong brought more than two hundred experts with him! </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Yaowen, all of you…” Someone stared at the experts behind Huang Xiaolong and gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> “Capture them all.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother wasting time as he gave the order immediately. </p>
			<p> Wang Zaixu, Zhu Yaowen, and the rest leaped into action immediately. 𝙛𝙧𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝙤𝙫𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝓶</p>
			<p> Seeing as the situation was spiraling out of control, Jiang Qiuping wanted to escape. However, his plan was promptly foiled by Zhu Yaowen and another expert at the peak of the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> “Zhu Yaowen, how dare you betray Lord Kun Feng?! Are you not afraid of the consequences?!” Jiang Qiuping roared. </p>
			<p> He couldn’t understand why all of them would submit to Huang Xiaolong, a God of Creation at the large completion stage! </p>
			<p> Ignoring the question, Zhu Yaowen worked with the other expert to take Jiang Qiuping down. </p>
			<p> “Xiaolong, save my father! Please save the Solitary Alliance!” Jiang Shaoyu rushed over to Huang Xiaolong and she pleaded with him, “The Creation Palace joined forces with the Eternal Heaven Alliance to surround my alliance! They started killing the moment they arrived! Please… Please save them!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3559 – Shattered Formation&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jiang Shaoyu might not know why those people standing behind Huang Xiaolong submitted to him, but he was the only person she could count on! Without thinking further, she begged Huang Xiaolong as tears streamed down her face. </p>
			<p> “The Creation Palace joined hands with the Eternal Heaven Alliance?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. It seemed as though the worst case scenario had happened. </p>
			<p> He might be the strongest existence in the First Universe, but he would find it annoying to deal with Kun Feng, Xuan Hong, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong if they joined hands. </p>
			<p> “Yes… They plan on swallowing the Solitary Alliance, Hundred Empire Alliance, and all the smaller powers! They would split the First Universe evenly between them!” An expert from the Solitary Alliance explained. “Fellow cultivator Huang Xiaolong, please save us! We will definitely return the favor in the future!” </p>
			<p> “Fellow cultivator Huang, please save our alliance!” The experts of the Solitary Alliance pleaded in unison. </p>
			<p> “How many experts did they send to attack your alliance?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “More than two hundred from each organization came! There should be four hundred of them in total!” Jiang Shaoyu explained. </p>
			<p> “Four hundred…” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. With his current strength and the subordinates he captured in the Unknown Lands, they would probably win when it came down to an all out brawl. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated as he dealt with the experts from the Creation Palace. In an instant, he suppressed them all in the Sun Moon Furnace.  </p>
			<p> “We’re going to the Solitary Alliance right now!” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Wang Zaixu and the rest. </p>
			<p> Activating the flying ship, they changed their course to head towards the headquarters of the Solitary Alliance. </p>
			<p> As they weren’t too far away, they could probably reach in two short days! The only question was, could Jiang Hong and the others hold out for that long? </p>
			<p> The Solitary Alliance had two hundred experts. They were severely outnumbered by their opponents! </p>
			<p> They could only rely on the Solitary Alliance’s grand formation to delay the slaughter! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Jiang Shaoyu’s anxious expression and he sighed, “Relax… They might have brought so many people along, but breaking through the grand formation isn’t an easy matter. They might need a few days to do so.” </p>
			<p> Calming down slightly, Jiang Shaoyu finally thought of the capabilities of the grand formation. The only problem was that she left the alliance three days ago! Since they needed two days to return, the formation might not be able to hold out! </p>
			<p> The more she thought about it, the more sullen her expression became. </p>
			<p> “Xiaolong, can we go faster?” Jiang Shaoyu asked. </p>
			<p> “This is the fastest we can go…” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> Jiang Shaoyu’s expression sank slightly. </p>
			<p> While Huang Xiaolong told them to hurry up, he got Tao Shi and the rest to uncover what was happening in the Solitary Alliance. </p>
			<p> Two days passed in a flash, and Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived above the Solitary City. </p>
			<p> With the strength of the Creation Palace, they had long since conquered the city. The great army of the Creation Palace locked the place down, preventing anyone from escaping. There were countless troops standing guard around the city, and they blocked out the skies. At the very least, there were a trillion troops! </p>
			<p> As the army was formed by the elites from the various celestial empires under the Creation Palace, the weakest soldier was a Primal Ancestor! Captains of their squad were Dao Venerables, and the generals were those who had comprehended the elements. Their great marshal was someone who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level!  </p>
			<p> However, they were completely useless when it came to stopping Huang Xiaolong’s group. Driving the high-grade creation artifact-level flying ship forward, they met with no opposition. </p>
			<p> The army might be able to hold out against several Gods of Creation at the small completion stage, but they were like dust in the air when matched up with Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Every single second, countless experts would explode into blood mist as they were unable to avoid the flying ship. </p>
			<p> From far, the flying ship looked as though it was traveling through a bloodied river! 𝙛𝓻𝙚𝙚𝔀𝙚𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong charged towards the headquarters of the Solitary Alliance, Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen who were in charge of the offensive received a report of a mysterious group of experts coming to the Solitary Alliance’s aid. </p>
			<p> They looked at each other in shock. </p>
			<p> “Do you know who they are?! How many people did they bring?” Xuan Hong asked. </p>
			<p> “We do not know how many people they brought. However, they’re using the second palace master’s flying ship!” </p>
			<p> Out of all the flying ships Huang Xiaolong had, Kai Dong’s flying ship was of the highest quality! </p>
			<p> “Second Brother?!” Xuan Hong frowned. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Could it be Huang Xiaolong and Tao Shi?” Chen Yizhen growled angrily. </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong’s expression started to sink. “Huang Xiaolong! We’ve been looking for you for millions of years! Who would have thought that you would send yourself to us?” </p>
			<p> “There is something off about Palace Master Kai Dong’s disappearance. Now that Huang Xiaolong is back, we need to be careful. Should we call Palace Master Kun Feng and the others?” </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong shook his head. “My big brother is stationed in the Creation Palace. It would take months for him to rush over.” Glancing at Chen Yizhen, Xuan Hong muttered, “Even without him, the two of us should be more than enough to take Huang Xiaolong down. We have so many experts here and there is no need to be afraid of Huang Xiaolong!”  </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen swept his gaze across the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance before nodding his head solemnly. </p>
			<p> “We have to break the formation as soon as possible!” Xuan Hong yelled. “I’ll give you an hour to destroy the grand formation of the Solitary Alliance!” </p>
			<p> After so many days of bombardment, the great formation of the Solitary Alliance was in tatters. They were confident of breaking through in an hour. </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong was already killing his way over, it would take several hours for him to arrive. </p>
			<p> One hour later… </p>
			<p> A massive explosion rang through the skies as the barrier of light formed by the formation slowly started to dissipate. </p>
			<p> A sinister laughter left Xuan Hong’s lips as he laid down his order. “Kill!” </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen led the experts of both factions into the Solitary Alliance. </p>
			<p> However, a massive palm emerged from the void to stop them dead in their tracks. Jiang Hong and the experts of the Solitary Alliance tore through the air and stood before Chen Yizhen. </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong roared with laughter when he saw Jiang Hong. “Jiang Hong, all of you should surrender immediately. When we conquer the thirteen universes, you’ll be heavily rewarded! Isn’t that much better than your current situation?!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3560 – Exterminated?&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jiang Hong snorted in contempt, “Xuan Hong, who do you think you are to ask me to surrender to the Creation Palace? You’re overestimating yourself!” He turned to looked at Chen Yizhen and he sneered, “Chen Yizhen, you despicable b*stard! You went against our agreement!” </p>
			<p> In the past, the Eternal Heaven Alliance and the Solitary Alliance made a pact to defend each other in case anyone came under attack. Now, Chen Yizhen was leading the Eternal Heaven Alliance to attack alongside the Creation Palace! It wasn’t a stretch for Jiang Hong to yell at him. </p>
			<p> When Chen Yizhen heard what Jiang Hong said, a trace of rage filled his heart. His expression sank and he growled, “Jiang Hong, the winners will always be king! Today, we’re the winners, and you're the losers! In the future, we’ll make the rules!” </p>
			<p> “I’ll give you one last chance to surrender.” </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen locked on to Jiang Hong. </p>
			<p> Turning around, Jiang Hong rallied the experts of the Solitary Alliance. “Brothers, today, we’ll fight till the last man standing!” </p>
			<p> “To the death!” </p>
			<p> The experts of the Solitary Alliance roared in unison.. </p>
			<p> “Alright, go to hell then.” Xuan Hong snorted and he lunged towards Jiang Hong. Chen Yizhen did the same, and they summoned their creation artifacts. They discussed the battle plan before. As soon as they destroyed the grand formation around the Solitary Alliance, they would take Jiang Hong down immediately. They wouldn’t give him a chance to escape!  </p>
			<p> The battle erupted instantly. Yells filled the skies as space itself was torn apart. </p>
			<p> There were close to six hundred Gods of Creation involved in the battle, and the shockwaves of the battle were enough to cause the universe to shake! </p>
			<p> Countless creeds contained in the Solitary Alliance were turned to dust immediately, and the number of deaths was uncountable! The grand armies formed in the various celestial empires were vaporized before they could react. </p>
			<p> Even though the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance outnumbered the Solitary Alliance by more than two times, they were unable to end the battle immediately. After all, Huang Xiaolong took away a huge part of their strength! </p>
			<p> Three hours later… </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong glared at Jiang Hong whose body was stained with blood. After three hours of grueling battle, Jiang Hong was in a sorry shape. His chest had a gaping hole, and there were wounds all around his body. </p>
			<p> “Jiang Hong, do you regret it now?” Xuan Hong gloated, “From today onwards, the Solitary Alliance will no longer exist!” Pointing to his surroundings, he continued, “Look at what you’ve done. Because of your decision, all of them were forced to die!” </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong looked around and he saw the sorry state of everyone on his side. There were some who lost their eye, and others lost their limbs. There were even some of them who only had half their bodies left! </p>
			<p> A sigh escaped Jiang Hong’s lips. </p>
			<p> “Why are we wasting our breath on him?” Chen Yizhen sneered as his creation artifact slashed towards Jiang Hong. It was the weapon that caused the wound on Jiang Hong’s chest. </p>
			<p> Right before Jiang Hong could avoid the attack, Xuan Hong waved his arm and rays of light descended from the void to trap him in place. </p>
			<p> As Chen Yizhen’s weapon was about to stab straight through Jiang Hong’s body again, the universe trembled as an uncountable number of silvery dragons swatted the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance away. </p>
			<p> The largest of the two dragons shot towards Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen. In a state of panic, the two of them directed their attacks away from Jiang Hong. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> As their arms went numb, they were sent tumbling through the air. Looking at the source of the attack, they discovered that the silver dragons that struck them were actually branches that glowed softly with starlight.  </p>
			<p> The top-grade creation artifacts in their hands were unable to leave a single scratch on it! </p>
			<p> This… </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong and the experts of the Solitary Alliance were shocked. </p>
			<p> The silver dragons that appeared earlier disappeared all of a sudden, and a figure took their place. </p>
			<p> Everyone who saw the newcomer gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?!” Jiang Hong, Chen Yizhen, and the others were flabbergasted. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, he arrived before them. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, you finally decided to show yourself! Where’s my second brother?!” Xuan Hong roared. “Was that the Star Dragon Divine Tree?!” </p>
			<p> Even though he only revealed the branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Xuan Hong was a half step Universe God. He recognized it instantly. 𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> The experts of the Creation Palace widened their eyes in shock. </p>
			<p> “You’re right. That was the Star Dragon Divine Tree. As for your second brother…” Huang Xiaolong released the restriction on the Sun Moon Furnace for them to peer inside, and they saw Kai Dong suppressed within. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at [ FreeWebNovel.com ]. </p>
			<p> “Second Brother!” Xuan Hong roared and he charged at Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to retrieve the furnace. However, he was sent flying from a single punch by Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> As he spun through the air, he vomited mouthfuls of blood. </p>
			<p> Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, including Jiang Hong and Chen Yizhen.  </p>
			<p> Even though he used the Star Dragon Divine Tree earlier, no one saw him controlling it. They thought that it was controlled by a hidden expert on Huang Xiaolong’s side. When they saw how easily Huang Xiaolong dealt with Xuan Hong, they felt as though an explosion went off in their heads. </p>
			<p> A half step Universe God was defeated by a God of Creation at the large completion stage! </p>
			<p> None of them could believe their eyes! </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong was similarly stunned. He wiped the blood off his lips and he turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong in confusion. </p>
			<p> “Are you surprised?” Huang Xiaolong muttered before walking towards the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance. </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong retreated subconsciously. </p>
			<p> “Go!” Xuan Hong barked out an order, and everyone snapped back to reality. They charged at Huang Xiaolong at once. </p>
			<p> The moment they did, a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Starlight fell from the void to surround them. </p>
			<p> A punch landed on the chest of the expert nearest to him and emerged from the man’s back, destroying his physical body instantly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. With another punch, he shattered the skull of another expert.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3561 – Bad Luck&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When the experts of the Creation Palace saw how easily Huang Xiaolong eliminated two experts at the peak of the grand completion stage, they screeched to a halt. Those were experts at the peak of the grand completion stage! They failed to survive a single blow! </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen couldn’t believe their eyes. Their eyelids didn’t stop twitching. </p>
			<p> Not even top-grade creation artifacts could destroy the body of an expert at the peak of the grand completion stage easily. Chen Yizhen only managed to injure Jiang Hong after repeated attacks in their drawn out battle. </p>
			<p> Now… </p>
			<p> When Xuan Hong and the others were thinking of what to do next, a crisp voice rang through the air. “Father!” </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to see a giant flying ship traveling towards them. It was the flying ship Kai Dong used when he left to huntdown Huang Xiaolong, but now, it changed hands! The experts standing on the bow of the ship were on Huang Xiaolong’s side! </p>
			<p> As the situation was getting too dire, Huang Xiaolong chose to fly over alone. Jiang Shaoyu and the others could only try to keep up in the flying ship. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Shaoyu!” Jiang Hong yelled when he saw his daughter.  </p>
			<p> Jiang Shaoyu and the experts of the Solitary Alliance who left to protect her quickly flew over to Jiang Hong’s side. </p>
			<p> “Father, are you alright?” Jiang Shaoyu asked after inspecting the wounds on her father’s body. </p>
			<p> “I’m fine.” Jiang Hong chuckled. “As long as you’re alright, nothing else matters. When you left, I thought…” Several days ago, he fell into despair after learning that the Creation Palace was hunting his daughter down. Now that she returned in one piece, he could stop worrying about her. 𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> “I’m fine! Xiaolong saved me when we were surrounded by the members of the Creation Palace!” Jiang Shaoyu explained. </p>
			<p> Wang Zaixu and the others disembarked the flying ship and flew towards Huang Xiaolong. Getting to their knees, they greeted him together, “Your Highness!” </p>
			<p> Their greeting ignited the rage in Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen. </p>
			<p> “All of you f*cking traitors! How dare you betray the Creation Palace?!” Xuan Hong growled, “When I return, I’ll exterminate your celestial empires! I’ll kill every living being there! If I fail to do so, I’ll change my name!” </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen looked at Tao Shi and the others and he swore, “Tao Shi, do you know how well we treated you all these years?! Since you chose to betray us, you can’t blame us for being heartless. We’ll kill every single person related to you!” </p>
			<p> Tao Shi snorted in response, “Chen Yizhen, didn’t you and Lin Tong create the Eternal Heaven Alliance to go against the Creation Palace? Now, all of you chose to work with them! You’re the true traitor! All of you deserve to die!” </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen screamed in anger, “Kill them all! Kill the traitors!” </p>
			<p> The war that was placed on hold started once again. </p>
			<p> “Kill Huang Xiaolong and the traitors!” Xuan Hong’s order came too. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance swarmed Huang Xiaolong instantly. </p>
			<p> Once again, the universe trembled under the shockwaves of the battle.  </p>
			<p> The battle was even more intense than before. The space around them crumbled like dust as their attacks smashed into each other. </p>
			<p> “Brothers, we’ll fight to the death!” Jiang Hong passed down his order too. The experts of the Solitary Alliance joined Huang Xiaolong to launch their counterattack. </p>
			<p> The members of the Solitary Alliance might have suffered some injuries, but that didn’t diminish their strength. After all, they were Gods of Creation. With the support from Huang Xiaolong’s army, they were more than capable of standing up to the combined forces of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance. </p>
			<p> The others might be stuck in a deadlock, but Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen were questioning life as they fought with Huang Xiaolong. They might be able to suppress Huang Xiaolong’s strength with their control over the universe energy, but Huang Xiaolong had 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy! It wasn’t a small gap at all! His physical body was stronger than that of ordinary half step Universe Gods! When he transformed into the Star Dragon Divine Tree, the two of them were beaten to a pulp! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste the past millions of years for nothing. Now, his offensive and defensive abilities had far surpassed the Huang Xiaolong of the past! Even if he stood there without moving, the two of them would find it hard to break through his defenses! </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen and Xuan Hong weren’t as sturdy as him! Every time they were stuck by his attack, they would vomit mouthfuls of blood. </p>
			<p> In less than half an hour, the two of them were close to being defeated. </p>
			<p> “Everyone at the peak of the grand completion stage, listen up! Come here and assist us in killing Huang Xiaolong!” Xuan Hong yelled in desperation. </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen did the same. </p>
			<p> To begin with, they didn’t have that many experts at the peak of the grand completion stage. The experts on Huang Xiaolong’s side and the Solitary Alliance weren’t useless either. The only ones who came to Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen’s aid were three miserable individuals who managed to leave the encirclement. One of them was from the Creation Palace and the other two were from the Eternal Heaven Alliance. </p>
			<p> It was too bad they were sending themselves to their deaths. The three of them were wiped out instantly by Huang Xiaolong and he threw their dao souls into the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen felt a stabbing pain running through their body and they knew that the outcome of the battle had been decided. </p>
			<p> “Leave!” </p>
			<p> “Run!”  </p>
			<p> They gave their final order before they tried to escape. </p>
			<p> The battle field erupted into chaos instantly as the experts of the two factions fled for their lives. </p>
			<p> How could Huang Xiaolong allow any of them to escape? He quickly gave the order to hunt all of them down before chasing after Xuan Hong himself. </p>
			<p> Xuan Hong snapped when he saw how Huang Xiaolong gave up chasing Chen Yizhen to hunt him down. “Huang Xiaolong, what’s the meaning of this? Why don’t you go for Chen Yizhen?!” </p>
			<p> “Well, you’re just unlucky. I don’t like the look on your face.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Bad luck?! Xuan Hong nearly vomited another mouthful of blood. </p>
			<p> As he ran for his life, he was eventually stopped by Huang Xiaolong. Like Kai Dong, he was suppressed in the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> By the time Huang Xiaolong returned to the Solitary Alliance, they were cleaning up the battlefield. </p>
			<p> “Your Highness!” </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong approached Huang Xiaolong and he bowed respectfully, “Many thanks to fellow cultivator Huang Xiaolong for saving my Solitary Alliance. Without you, we would have been exterminated! In the future, we will follow fellow cultivator Huang’s order without any questions!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3562 – 13.4 Billion&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jiang Hong declared his loyalty towards Huang Xiaolong. From what he said, there was no doubt about it. The Solitary Alliance would listen to Huang Xiaolong from that moment on. </p>
			<p> Waving his hands casually, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Alliance Leader Jiang Hong is taking this too seriously.” </p>
			<p> After talking for a little longer, Wang Zaixu, Tao Shi, and the others reported the outcome of the battle. </p>
			<p> Due to their relentless pursuit, they managed to capture eighty experts in total. One of them was at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> “It’s too bad the rest escaped…” Ao Shenghai sighed. </p>
			<p> More than three hundred of them managed to escape! </p>
			<p> “It’s fine. We’ll kill our way over. They won’t be able to run forever.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> After the battle, the strength of the two greatest alliances took a massive hit. Even someone at the level of Xuan Hong was captured! Even if Kun Feng worked with Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong, there was nothing for Huang Xiaolong to be afraid of. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong ordered for all the captured experts to be brought to him.  </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance trembled uncontrollably when they were brought over. </p>
			<p> They saw how badly Xuan Hong was beaten up by Huang Xiaolong earlier. Even a half step Universe God was trashed to the point of despair. If he wanted to deal with them, they would suffer endlessly! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the prisoners and locked on to two of them. </p>
			<p> There were five experts in the First Universe who possessed the Huang Long Bloodline, and the last two were kneeling before him! One of them was called Ao Fei, a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and the other was Ao Bifeng, a God of Creation at the large completion stage! </p>
			<p> When they saw him walking over to them, they felt despair blooming in their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong, we don’t mean any disrespect! We only fought you because we had our orders!” Ao Fei stuttered. </p>
			<p> Ao Bifeng nodded and begged for mercy. </p>
			<p> Without the patience to explain himself, Huang Xiaolong tossed them into the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> No one dared to speak up for them for fear of incurring Huang Xiaolong’s wrath. </p>
			<p> “Relax. I won’t kill anyone who surrenders.” Huang Xiaolong spoke while looking at the others. “You only have one chance. Think carefully about the decision you’re about to make.” </p>
			<p> “I… I am willing to submit! I will fulfill Lord Huang Xiaolong’s orders even if it costs me my life!” One of the God of Creation Realm experts from the Creation Palace yelled. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> In the headquarters of the Eternal Heaven Alliance… </p>
			<p> “What?! The great army formed by the experts of our faction and the Creation Palace lost?!” Lin Tong stared at Jiang Yan in disbelief. </p>
			<p> With a complicated expression Jiang Yan continued, “Yes… The Solitary Alliance was about to be exterminated when Huang Xiaolong showed up! He saved Jiang Hong from Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen’s combined assault.” </p>
			<p> “Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!” Lin Tong stared at Jiang Yan with his eyes wide open. </p>
			<p> “That’s right… We’ve been underestimating the kid all this while. He managed to create three great worlds!” Jiang Yan felt his throat going dry and he explained, “From those who escaped, we learned that Huang Xiaolong has more than 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy! In fact, it’s possible that he has already surpassed the 12 billion units mark! Moreover, he has the Star Dragon Divine Tree!” </p>
			<p> “Xuan Hong and Alliance Leader Chen failed to deal with him even when they worked together.” </p>
			<p> Lin Tong fell back in his chair as waves crashed against his heart. 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy?! Star Dragon Divine Tree?! </p>
			<p> “Ao Ying and the rest were captured by Huang Xiaolong alone… He didn’t bring any hidden experts along with him.” A bitter smile formed on Jiang Yan’s face. “This time, our alliance leader managed to escape. Xuan Hong wasn’t so lucky.” </p>
			<p> With a frown on his face, Jiang Yan muttered, “Now, only Palace Master Mei Jie can suppress Huang Xiaolong! However, he’s been missing for some time now. Not even Kun Feng can contact him.” </p>
			<p> In other words, in the First Universe, no one could stop Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Jiang Yan mentioned some stuff about the battle, and Lin Tong’s face turned green when he heard that Tao Shi and the others had submitted to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Send out our men to exterminate Tao Shi’s celestial empire!” Lin Tong roared with rage. </p>
			<p> “No!” Jiang Yan pleaded. “Alliance Leader, the most important thing is for Chen Yizhen to return. We need to form an alliance with Kun Feng immediately to resist Huang Xiaolong. Exterminating Tao Shi’s celestial empire will appease your anger for now, but it’s useless!” </p>
			<p> Lin Tong’s expression sank and he eventually decided to listen to Jiang Yan. </p>
			<p> “Also, we need to call upon the Hundred Empire Alliance for support.” Jiang Yan continued, “With the Creation Palace and the Hundred Empire Alliance, we won’t be afraid of Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> “But… That’s easier said than done.” Lin Tong frowned. </p>
			<p> “They should have already learned about the battle in the Solitary Alliance. They should be afraid that he would move against them next, and we can use that to pull them in!” </p>
			<p> “Alright, let’s do it!” Lin Tong nodded in agreement. </p>
			<p> It was too bad the news of the Hundred Empire Alliance’s surrender came a few days later. Huang Xiaolong made his move earlier than expected. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength and Wang Zaixu’s assistance, the Hundred Empire Alliance quickly surrendered. </p>
			<p> “F*CK!” Lin Tong roared with rage as he destroyed everything around him.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. He brought everyone to launch a massive offensive on the Eternal Heaven Alliance. When he arrived, Lin Tong was nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> “Your Highness, we discovered that Lin Tong, Chen Yizhen, and Kun Feng are currently hiding in the Creation Palace.” Ao Shenghai said. “Should we attack them right now?” 𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly. “Not for now.” </p>
			<p> With the grand formation left behind by Mei Jie, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do a thing to them with 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> After deciding against launching an offensive, Huang Xiaolong chose to enter seclusion. </p>
			<p> Before he did, he passed down an order to gather every single expert in the God of Creation Realm. </p>
			<p> Other than those in the great alliances, there were close to four hundred Gods of Creation lying around. They were an extremely powerful source of strength if he could gain their support. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion for over two hundred thousand years. When he devoured the Huang Long Bloodline in Ao Fei and Ao Bifeng, the amount of grand cosmos energy he accumulated reached the 13.4 billion mark. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong also used the treasures Kai Dong, Xuan Hong, and the others had on them to bring the Purple Lightning Peak and Sun Moon Furnace to the high-grade cosmos artifact level. </p>
			<p> When he emerged from his seclusion, he was shocked to discover a message delivered by Pangu.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3563 – Appearance of Meng Tian and Huang Sheng&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “What?! Meng Tian actually found Huang Sheng and they formed an alliance?!” Huang Xiaolong stared at Pangu in shock. </p>
			<p> “Yes.” Pangu sighed. “The two of them gathered more than two hundred Gods of Creation from god knows where to launch an all-out attack against the Blazing Dragon World! If not for the Star Dragon Couple and the three Bamboo Ancestors, the Blazing Dragon World would have long since been destroyed!” </p>
			<p> “Even with their strength, we can’t hold out for long! The other side brought too many experts over! There are more than thirty of them at the peak of the grand completion stage!” </p>
			<p> “There are over fifty of them at the grand completion stage!” Pangu gnashed his teeth in annoyance. “Meng Tian and Huang Sheng also declared that they would destroy the Pangu World after they are done with the Blazing Dragon World! They plan to destroy everything related to you!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong planned to deal with Kun Feng, Lin Tong, and Chen Yizhen now that he left seclusion. After hearing what Pangu said, he could only return to the Blazing Dragon Universe to deal with the two. </p>
			<p> He had been looking for the two of them for a long time. Now that they finally appeared, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to let them escape. It was especially so for Huang Sheng. The moment he captured Huang Sheng, his father would be able to recover! </p>
			<p> Pangu shook his head when he heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to return to the Blazing Dragon Universe. “Even if you, Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi return, you won’t be able to do anything.” </p>
			<p> Read the most updated version of this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> When he rushed into the First Universe in a state of panic, he contacted Ao Shenghai immediately to look for Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t learn about anything that happened in the years that passed, and he didn’t know that his disciple had subdued countless experts.  </p>
			<p> As for the fact that Huang Xiaolong had more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, it was impossible for Pangu to find out. After all, he didn’t even try! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stared at Pangu in stunned silence for a moment before bursting out in laughter, “Master, didn’t you hear about everything that happened in the First Universe?!” </p>
			<p> “Huh?! What are you talking about?” Pangu frowned. </p>
			<p> “Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi won’t be the only ones following me back to the Blazing Dragon Universe! Now, I control half the forces in the First Universe!” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Pangu roared as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, flabbergasted. </p>
			<p> That wasn’t half a great world they were talking about! That was half the First Universe! </p>
			<p> Hold up… Wasn’t there more than thirteen hundred Gods of Creation in the First Universe?! </p>
			<p> Wouldn’t that mean… </p>
			<p> The look in Pangu’s eyes changed when he stared at his disciple. </p>
			<p> “I have more than eight subordinates at the God of Creation Realm now.” Huang Xiaolong snickered. </p>
			<p> “?!” Pangu felt his tongue going stiff and a look of confusion formed on his face. </p>
			<p> In the Blazing Dragon Universe, there were forty Gods of Creation at best. </p>
			<p> “Yes…” Huang Xiaolong smiled. In the years he spent in seclusion, a large group of experts came to swear their loyalty to him.  </p>
			<p> Without exaggeration, Huang Xiaolong controlled the strongest faction in the First Universe. Not even the combination of the Eternal Heaven Alliance and Creation Palace could rival him! Their remaining forces numbered in the five hundred range at best. </p>
			<p> After thinking about it for a moment, Huang Xiaolong gathered everyone and chose three hundred of them to follow him back to the Blazing Dragon Universe. </p>
			<p> When he left, he told Wang Zaixu and the others to wait for his return. They were to guard the headquarters at all cost and they had to avoid clashing with the members of the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> Boarding a top-grade creation artifact-level flying ship, they left the First Universe. </p>
			<p> The flying ship was something he managed to obtain from Xuan Hong, and it was the fastest flying ship he had in his possession. </p>
			<p> When Pangu stared at the flying ship beneath his feet, he sighed, “Xiaolong, thanks to you, I can finally step foot on a top-grade flying ship. Hahaha!” </p>
			<p> “You can have it when we return. Play with it however you wish.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Pangu stared at Huang Xiaolong in fright. “What?! I can’t accept something so expensive?! Isn’t this the only top-grade flying ship you have?! If I take it, what are you going to use?” </p>
			<p> “Kun Feng has another one on him. I’ll rob him later.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> “I’ll definitely not take it then! If the old dragon asks me where I get it, you’ll look like a bad disciple for favoring one master!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded eventually. Since Pangu didn’t want it, he wouldn’t force the matter. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop for a second. He charged straight towards the Blazing Dragon Universe. If they ran into any planets or great worlds, he would shift them to the side. </p>
			<p> Even so, it took them several months to return. After all, the distance between two universes was too large! 𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚 </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong charged straight for the Blazing Dragon World the moment they returned. </p>
			<p> When that was happening, Meng Tian and Huang Sheng were staring coldly at the Blazing Dragon Celestial Palace. They sent their disciples to bombard the grand formation endlessly. </p>
			<p> In the time it took Huang Xiaolong to return, Meng Tian and Huang Sheng had long since destroyed the formation around the Blazing Dragon World. Now, everyone focused their defenses on the grand formation around the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “God damn it! How did Huang Xiaolong get to know the Star Dragon Couple?! If not for them we would have wiped out the old dragon a long time ago!” Meng Tian roared. </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng sneered in response, “So what if they’re half step Universe Gods, this will end soon.” </p>
			<p> Even though the Star Dragon Couple were strong, they only had thirty odd experts defending the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire. Meng Tian and the others brought two hundred Gods of Creation over. They won in sheer quantity! </p>
			<p> Half a month passed, and the barrier around the celestial palace started to tremble. </p>
			<p> “If this keeps up, the barrier will shatter in less than an hour!” Ao Xing started to panic. Turning to Huang Long, he said, “The moment it does, I’ll cover your escape.” </p>
			<p> With their strength, the Star Dragon Couple would be able to ensure the safety of Huang Long. However, the same couldn’t be said for the others. </p>
			<p> “But…” Huang Long frowned.</p>

			</title>
			<p> “What will happen if we leave?!” Huang Long asked. </p>
			<p> The old dragon shook his head and sighed, “We’ll save anyone we can. The reason you were captured was because of me. If you fall into Huang Sheng’s hands again, I won’t be able to explain myself to Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> Huang Long stared at the old dragon and sighed. </p>
			<p> Very quickly, half an hour passed. </p>
			<p> The formation around the palace shattered with a massive blast and debris was flung everywhere. </p>
			<p> The faces of the old dragon and the others changed. </p>
			<p> They didn’t expect the enemy to break their defenses so quickly! </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> As soon as the formation was shattered, Meng Tian and the rest charged into the palace with their creation artifacts in hand.  </p>
			<p> Roaring with laughter, Huang Sheng addressed them, “You old f*ck, we meet again!” </p>
			<p> He turned to look at Huang Long and he continued, “Huang Long, since you chose to return, you can’t blame me for what is about to happen! Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to save you this time!” </p>
			<p> Huang Long glared at Huang Sheng as killing intent flashed through his eyes, “Huang Sheng, watch yourself. One day, Xiaolong will refine your bloodline and devour your soul!” </p>
			<p> “Devour my soul? Haha! Let’s see if that little brat is capable enough.” He waved his hand and ordered, “Take them down! Do not let a single one escape!” </p>
			<p> The experts behind him nodded in unison and they pounced at Huang Long, the Blazing Dragon, and the others. </p>
			<p> In order to stop the Star Dragon Couple, Meng Tian led twenty experts over to surround them. </p>
			<p> They failed to break through the encirclement in a short amount of time. </p>
			<p> As for Huang Long, he was under attack by four experts at the grand completion stage. None of them were weaker than him when he was at his peak state! Due to his injuries, he was quickly taken down. </p>
			<p> Meng Tian and Huang Sheng rejoiced when they saw that Huang Long had fallen into their hands. </p>
			<p> “Huang Long, this time, you should surrender to fate. I’ll devour your bloodline and dao soul this time!” Huang Sheng roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> However, a ray of silvery light tore through the void and shot towards the giant group of attackers. Meng Tian and Huang Sheng failed to react when a horrible shriek came from one of their men. </p>
			<p> The individual who was sent flying had a hole in his forehead by the time they looked at him. </p>
			<p> Three more rays of light tore through the skies. </p>
			<p> “Be careful!” Huang Sheng and Meng Tian yelled at the same time. </p>
			<p> They were a tad too late. The three Gods of Creation who were standing beside Huang Long were sent flying. </p>
			<p> Everyone stopped dead in their tracks when they saw the sudden change in situation. </p>
			<p> Silence descended on the lands. </p>
			<p> “It’s the Silver Soul Spike from the Creation Palace!” The Star Dragon Couple recognized the weapon immediately. </p>
			<p> Creation Palace! </p>
			<p> Silver Soul Spike!  </p>
			<p> The faces of Meng Tian and the others changed. </p>
			<p> The Silver Soul Spike was one of the most terrifying weapons in the Creation Palace. It was said that there were only a hundred of them to begin with! Only the four palace masters were able to use them. Whenever a Silver Soul Spike was used, they would pierce directly into the target’s soul! Their grand cosmos energy would be sealed immediately and they would enter a state of paralysis. </p>
			<p> Did a palace master of the Creation Palace arrive? </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple were shocked. They didn’t understand why the Creation Palace would save Huang Long. </p>
			<p> When everyone was confused, a massive flying ship appeared in their sights. </p>
			<p> The flying ship approached at a terrifying speed and it emitted extremely powerful waves of energy. </p>
			<p> “This is a top-grade flying ship! It belongs to Xuan Hong of the Creation Palace!” Ao Xing was shocked. </p>
			<p> A flying ship belonging to a palace master of the Creation Palace! </p>
			<p> When they saw who was standing on the bow of the ship, they were shocked. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p> “Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p> “Your Highness!” </p>
			<p> Meng Tian, Huang Sheng, Ao Xing, Huang Long, and everyone present yelled in unison. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was standing beside Pangu, Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi as they stared at everyone standing below. The three hundred experts Huang Xiaolong brought back were nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> When everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, he retrieved the ship and approached Huang Long. </p>
			<p> “Father, Master, I’m late.” </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng roared with laughter all of a sudden. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re right on time! Hahaha! You’re here for the best part!” </p>
			<p> “Hold it. Be careful. It might be a trap.” Meng Tian reminded him. Huang Xiaolong’s sudden arrival made him slightly cautious. After all, why would the Creation Palace give Huang Xiaolong a top-grade flying ship? Did a palace master come with Huang Xiaolong? Where were they? </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng nodded when he heard what Meng Tian said. He turned to Huang Xiaolong and muttered, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re pretty capable! Who would have thought that you could invite the members of the Creation Palace over to help you?” Alright, there’s no need to hide it anymore. You can bring them out now.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned. It seemed as though Huang Sheng was pretty confident in himself. He didn’t seem to look highly upon the Creation Palace at all! What could he be relying on?  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Sheng and Meng Tian before staring at the experts they brought over. Other than the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance, no other alliance seemed to possess so many experts. </p>
			<p> As for thirty over experts at the peak of the grand completion stage, not even the Creation Palace would be able to mobilize so many of them! </p>
			<p> Where in the world did Huang Sheng and Meng Tian find them? </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong summoned the experts he brought while questioning the source of Meng Tian’s power. </p>
			<p> With his summon, three hundred experts appeared in the skies. 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> Huang Sheng and Meng Tian looked around them in shock. They couldn’t believe their eyes. “Three… Three hundred experts at the God of Creation Realm?!” </p>
			<p> The Creation Palace only had three hundred of them at the peak of their strength. How could they send everyone to assist Huang Xiaolong?! </p>
			<p> Huang Long, the old dragon, and the Star Dragon Couple were equally as stunned. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Huang Sheng and Meng Tian and returned their threats from earlier. “Huang Sheng, Meng Tian, I’ve been looking for you guys all these years. Who would have thought that you would jump out yourselves?! Today, none of you will escape.” </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng and Meng Tian’s expression fell, but they lunged at Huang Xiaolong in unison. No one expected them to move so suddenly. They couldn’t help Huang Xiaolong even if they wanted to!</p>

			</title>
			<p> “Be careful!” Ao Xing, Huang Long, and the others yelled. 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> In stark contrast to the expressions on the faces of those below, Tao Shi and the others stared at Meng Tian and Huang Sheng pitifully. </p>
			<p> Without much suspense, they were sent flying by a single kick from Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t pull his punches when dealing with the two of them. He used ninety percent of his strength in those kicks. </p>
			<p> Since his foot landed directly on their faces, their skulls shattered to bits. </p>
			<p> As their miserable shrieks pierced through the air, they were sent flying to a random corner of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, and Huang Long stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> “This…” The old dragon looked at Huang Sheng and Meng Tian who were beaten into the ground. Even with his strength, he couldn’t match up to Huang Sheng! Much less Meng Tian who was stronger than that! </p>
			<p> Despite that, the two of them were defeated by Huang Xiaolong with a single strike!  </p>
			<p> Questioning looks were thrown towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Noticing the look on their faces, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “While staying in the First Universe, I managed to accumulate more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” Pointing towards Zhu Yaowen, Yang Gang, and those who appeared in mid alr, he continued, “These are my subordinates.” </p>
			<p> 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> Three subordinates at the God of Creation Realm! </p>
			<p> Huang Long and the rest were at a loss for words after hearing what he said. </p>
			<p> If they knew that the three of them were only a small part of Huang Xiaolong’s faction, who knew what they would think?! </p>
			<p> The experts who came over with Meng Tian and Huang Sheng didn’t dare to make rash movements as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Taking a single step, Huang Xiaolong arrived above Meng Tian and Huang Sheng. As they were sent crashing deep into the earth, Huang Xiaolong casually waited for them to emerge. Their faces were completely disfigured. Even though he only used ninety percent of power in his kick, the two of them were far from able to resist it. </p>
			<p> Even half step Universe Gods would be beaten to a pulp by Huang Xiaolong, much less the two of them. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Sheng leaped into the air suddenly as a giant axe appeared in his hand. It was the top-grade creation artifact he had been nurturing and it came slashing down towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, go to hell!” </p>
			<p> Raising his hand casually, Huang Xiaolong blocked the axe with his bare hands. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>

			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s arm was completely fine, but a nick appeared on Huang Sheng’s axe! His eyes bulged when he saw the outcome of the exchange. </p>
			<p> He had nurtured his Dragon Axe for countless years, and he used an extraordinary amount of treasure to do so! Even if he fought with Pangu who had the Pangu Axe, there was no way his weapon would be damaged! </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as though they were looking at a monster. </p>
			<p> If he could stop a top-grade creation artifact with his own body, wouldn’t that make his physique comparable to universe treasures?! Even if it couldn’t, it wouldn’t be that far off! </p>
			<p> When Huang Sheng was still stuck in a daze, Huang Xiaolong’s fist arrived. It pierced through Huang Sheng’s chest and blew a hole through the man’s dao heart! </p>
			<p> Meng Tian, who had barely crawled out from his hole, was about to rush up to give Huang Xiaolong a piece of his mind too. He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw what happened to Huang Sheng. </p>
			<p> Turning around slowly, Huang Xiaolong revealed a smile when he looked at Meng Tian. </p>
			<p> “Why aren’t you guys doing anything?! Take him down right now!” Meng Tian roared at the experts who came along with him. </p>
			<p> Snapping back to reality, they charged towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Open the formation! Capture them all!” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhu Yaowen. </p>
			<p> They were busy setting up a grand formation earlier, and that was the reason they didn’t appear together with Huang Xiaolong. Even though the formation was hastily arranged, they were still able to stop Meng Tian and the others from escaping immediately. The short delay was more than enough for Huang Xiaolong to deal with them. </p>
			<p> The moment he gave the order, the grand formation was revealed to the world. A massive barrier of light formed in the skies above, blocking off all connection to the outside world. Zhu Yaowen and the others charged at the experts Meng Tian and Huang Sheng brought. The battle reached its climax immediately. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, Huang Long, and the others charged into the fray too. </p>
			<p> With the support Huang Xiaolong brought back with him, they could finally release all their pent up rage! </p>
			<p> “This is amazing!” Ao Xing roared with laughter while attacking the original assailants. </p>
			<p> After many months of living under the pressure of being attacked every day, Ao Xing could finally release all the resentment in his heart! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was in charge of suppressing Meng Tian and Huang Sheng. Even though he could take them down instantly, he chose to play around with them. Even though he didn’t use his full strength, they were still beaten black and blue. </p>
			<p> The two of them were experts who stood at the peak of the power pyramid in their respective universes, and they had never been humiliated their entire lives! In a fit of rage, they thought of sacrificing a part of their power to bring Huang Xiaolong down with them! </p>
			<p> Unfortunately, they were too weak to cause any serious damage to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> As the battle dragged on for half an hour, they were sent crashing into the ground countless times.  </p>
			<p> Crawling to their feet, they were in a terrible state. The divine armor around their bodies were in shambles, and bloodstains were everywhere. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, enough! We’re the Dragon Overlord’s subordinates!” Meng Tian glared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted, “If we fail to return, he will never forgive you! With his strength, he can eliminate half step Universe Gods as he pleases!” </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng continued, “That’s right! So what if you have 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy?! You’re nothing but a speck of dust before Lord Dragon!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned and he looked at the experts who came along with them. “Are all of them subordinates of the Dragon Overlord too?” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! Humph! You can’t possibly imagine how strong the Dragon Overlord is!” Huang Sheng sneered. “Huang Xiaolong, you better think twice.” </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple and the rest were flabbergasted when they heard what Meng Tian said. </p>
			<p> Dragon Overlord?! </p>
			<p> Exterminate half step Universe Gods?! </p>
			<p> “Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong stared at Huang Sheng with a glint of anger in his eyes. “Who the hell cares if he’s the Dragon Overlord?! He can be the Chicken Overlord for all I care! Today, none of you shall escape!” </p>
			<p> “Alright. I had enough fun messing with you guys. It’s time to end this.” Huang Xiaolong said before appearing before the two of them once again. With a simple palm strike, he crushed them into the ground.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3566 – Depths of the Unknown Space&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, release us immediately!” </p>
			<p> “The Dragon Overlord will never let you off!” </p>
			<p> Meng Tian and Huang Sheng roared desperately. </p>
			<p> Tightening his grip, the flames emerged from his body and incinerated the two of them. Howls emerged from their lips instantly. </p>
			<p> “We’ll talk when he comes.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before sealing their grand cosmos energy. He tossed them into the Sun Moon Furnace without a care in the world. </p>
			<p> After dealing with the two of them, he turned to the others. It didn’t take long for all two hundred experts to be suppressed. </p>
			<p> “Xiaolong, should we be worried about the Dragon Overlord?” Huang Long asked. </p>
			<p> “We’ll deal with it when the time comes. Even if the Dragon Overlord comes, I’ll be there to stop him.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> With 13.4 billion units of grand cosmos energy and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong truly wasn’t worried that the Dragon Overlord would come. After all, he would probably reach 15 billion units of grand cosmos energy after devouring Huang Sheng.  </p>
			<p> “That’s right… Brother Huang Long, the Dragon Overlord might possess shocking strength, but Xiaolong has three great worlds! He will definitely be the strongest in the thirteen universes!” Ao Xing grinned. “It won’t be long till Huang Xiaolong unifies the thirteen universes.” </p>
			<p> The Blazing Dragon smiled, “Now, I’m afraid even ten of me won’t be Xiaolong’s match.” </p>
			<p> “That’s not possible, right?” Huang Long stared at the old dragon in disbelief. </p>
			<p> However, the old dragon chuckles in amusement the next second. “Aren’t you at the peak of the grand completion stage? You should understand how strong someone is when they break through the 10 billion units mark.” The moment anyone breaks through the 10 billion units mark, they would enter a whole new realm! </p>
			<p> Ao Meixia chuckled, “He’s right. Even if Ao Xing and I work together, we won’t be able to block a single strike from Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> Huang Long stared at them in shock. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple were half step Universe Gods! Even so, they weren’t confident of taking a single hit from Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Huang Long looked at his son, and he was greeted by an annoying smirk on the brat’s face. It seemed as though they were right. If Huang Xiaolong had barely broken through the 10 billion mark, he might have fought to a draw with the Star Dragon Couple. Now, he has 13.4 billion units of grand cosmos energy! The strength he possessed was frightening! </p>
			<p> Huang Long felt a trace of joy when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s silent admission that he could defeat the Star Dragon Couple. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong gave the order for Zhu Yaowen and the others to clean up the battlefield, he returned to the imperial palace with the old dragon and the rest. </p>
			<p> When everyone had settled down, Huang Xiaolong told them everything that happened in the First Universe. </p>
			<p> He told them that he had more than eight hundred Gods of Creation serving under him back in the First Universe. </p>
			<p> “In the future, I’m going to have to rely on you, you little brat!” Huang Long chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> Everyone roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> Soon after, the blazing dragon arranged for a giant banquet. It was to celebrate Huang Xiaolong’s strength, and to celebrate Huang Sheng’s capture.  </p>
			<p> When the banquet was over, Huang Xiaolong started to treat Huang Long’s injury. He released Huang Sheng from the Sun Moon Furnace with a smirk on his face. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing?!” Huang Sheng could guess what they were going to do when he saw Huang Long and he started to panic. </p>
			<p> “What am I doing?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “Did you forget what you did to my father? I’ll return the favor right now. I’ll give you a taste of getting your bloodline refined!” </p>
			<p> Obviously, it wasn’t a nice feeling for one’s bloodline to be refined! </p>
			<p> When Huang Sheng was desperately struggling and yelling, Huang Xiaolong sent countless roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree into Huang Sheng’s body. He sucked out Huang Sheng’s bloodline bit by bit. </p>
			<p> He didn’t take the power for himself as he transferred it to his father, Huang Long! </p>
			<p> Sitting in the air, Huang Long circulated his secret art to receive the power. As Huang Sheng’s strength came from him in the first place, it didn’t take long for him to recover his strength. His injuries healed rapidly. </p>
			<p> Eventually, he returned to his peak state. </p>
			<p> A smile could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he asked, “Father, how do you feel?” 𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝒏𝓸𝒗𝓮𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> Huang Long nodded his head as he felt his strength returning. “It’s back! In fact, I’m pretty sure I grew a little stronger.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s great.” </p>
			<p> He finally treated Huang Long’s injuries! </p>
			<p> In order to save his father, Huang Xiaolong had been through a lot! Now, he could finally relax. </p>
			<p> Now that Huang Long had recovered, Huang Xiaolong chose to enter the seclusion to refine Huang Sheng’s remaining bloodline and his grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> Huang Sheng struggled unceasingly when Huang Xiaolong devoured him, but he failed to change his fate. </p>
			<p> Tens of thousands of years later, Huang Sheng reached the limit.  </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, I curse you! I won’t let you off even in death!” Huang Sheng screamed. “In the future, Lord Dragon will capture you and make you suffer a life worse than death! He will extract your soul” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong grabbed Huang Sheng by the neck and snorted, “Not to worry. I’ll extract your soul before that happens!” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he started to look through Huang Sheng’s soul. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on his face. He planned to look for clues on the Dragon Overlord in Huang Sheng’s mind, but it seemed as though the man didn’t know much either. He only knew that the Dragon overlord was located in the depths of the Unknown Lands. He didn’t even know the Dragon Overlord’s true strength! </p>
			<p> “Unknown Lands…” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. The Dragon Overlord was actually located at the depths of the Unknown Lands! </p>
			<p> From what Huang Sheng knew, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Unknown Space was massive! It was connected to all thirteen universes. He could enter the Unknown Lands from the Blazing Dragon Universe, but the only problem was locating the entrance. </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong became more and more interested in the Unknown Lands. The Universe Boat was located there too, and Mei Jie was somewhere within. Now, this unknown expert known as the ‘Dragon Overlord’ was there too! </p>
			<p> What in the world did the Unknown Land contain?! </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong searched through the souls of Meng Tian and the others, he discovered that there was a powerful restriction around their memories. Even with his strength, he couldn’t break through the restriction.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3567 – Yu Long&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When he realized that he wouldn’t be learning anything from Meng Tian and the others, Huang Xiaolong gave up reluctantly. Regardless, he would be heading over to the Unknown Lands in the future. He would know everything after some investigation. There wasn’t a need to worry about it now. </p>
			<p> Leaving seclusion, Huang Xiaolong looked for the Star Dragon Couple and Starly before heading back to the Star Dragon Universe. </p>
			<p> He needed to ask the Star Dragon universe something when he was back. He promised the Star Dragon Universe to kill Yu Long previously, and now, he might be unable to kill the man, but he could capture him! </p>
			<p> “Why do you need to return to the Star Dragon Universe?” Huang Long and the others were shocked by his sudden intention to head over. </p>
			<p> ‘I promised the supreme existence in the Dragon Eye Cliff to kill Yu Long.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t hide anything from them. “I only managed to locate the Star Dragon Divine Tree because of the supreme existence. Now, it’s time for me to fulfill my promise.” </p>
			<p> “There are some questions I wish to ask the supreme existence too.” </p>
			<p> After hearing his reason, no one had a reason to stop Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “When do you plan to head over?” Huang Long asked. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a moment before sighing, “I’ll go in a bit. I plan to head over to the World of Departed Souls to look for Xiaofei and the rest before leaving.”  </p>
			<p> He hadn’t seen them in several millions years. He couldn’t help thinking of them from time to time. </p>
			<p> “Alright, I’ll go back with you.” Huang Long smiled. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before they left for the World of Departed Souls. </p>
			<p> They arrived several days later. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had returned, everyone in the Huang Family cheered happily. </p>
			<p> After so many million years, everyone in the Huang Family had broken through. The weakest of them had broken through to the Primal Ancestor Realm. Most of them were in the Dao Venerable Realm, but they were quite a distance away from comprehending the elements. </p>
			<p> After spending several months with his wives, Huang Xiaolong decided to leave for the Star Dragon Universe. With the Star Dragon Couple, Starly, and the experts he brought with him from the First Universe, they headed towards their destination. </p>
			<p> Huang Long and Pangu chose not to follow Huang Xiaolong this time. With the members of the Huang Family, they sent him off. </p>
			<p> As for Wang Meiqi, she decided to remain behind with the Huang Family. As a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, she could guide everyone in their cultivation. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Several months later, Huang Xiaolong and the others finally arrived at the Star Dragon Universe. </p>
			<p> Rushing towards the Submerged Dragon Institute in Xuan Hong’s flying ship, Huang Xiaolong discovered a ton of experts going in the same direction. When he finally asked around, he discovered that the Submerged Dragon Institute would only hold their martial arts tournament every one hundred million years. Anyone under the God of Creation Realm could participate, and anyone who entered the top ten ranks would be rewarded with Yu Long’s guidance and creation-level pills. </p>
			<p> Yu Long invited the various celestial emperors and other Gods of Creation to the Submerged Dragon Institute for them to observe the competition. </p>
			<p> “Seems like we came at a good time.” Ao Xing chuckled. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded with a smile on his face. “Since it’s a martial art tournament, I guess I’ll have to exchange pointers with Yu Long.” </p>
			<p> “Heh, if Yu Long learns about your current strength, do you think he’ll agree to the exchange?” Ao Meixia snickered.  </p>
			<p> “Well, too bad he doesn’t know.” Huang Xiaolong grinned. </p>
			<p> As laughter rang through the air, the group traveled happily towards their destination. </p>
			<p> Several days later, they arrived at the entrance of the Submerged Dragon Institute. </p>
			<p> Looking at the structures around him, Huang Xiaolong sighed. When he entered the Submerged Dragon Institute with Pangu in the past, all he wanted to do was to find a way to cure his father’s injuries. Everything seemed to pass so quickly! </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was still thinking about the past, a voice rang through the air. “The Celestial Emperor of the Zhusheng Celestial Empire has arrived! Get out of the way!” </p>
			<p> The Zhusheng Celestial Empire was ranked in the top ten ranks in the Star Dragon Universe. The Zhisheng Celestial Emperor’s strength was comparable to Ao Wen of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire! </p>
			<p> Looking at each other, everyone on Huang Xiaolong’s ship chuckled. </p>
			<p> A mere celestial emperor wanted more than three hundred Gods of Creation to make way for him! Nothing could be more amusing. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned to Zhu Yaowen and muttered, “Scare them away.” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Your Highness!” Zhu Yaowen nodded before turning around to point at the flying ship approaching them. A terrifying ray of light broke a hole through the fabric of space and it flew past the Zhusheng Celestial Empire’s flying ship. </p>
			<p> A tear countless miles long could be seen as chaotic air spewed from within. </p>
			<p> Perhaps they were scared off by Zhu Yaowen’s display of strength, but the flying ship from the Zhusheng Celestial Empire stopped dead in their tracks. A shaky voice emerged from their flying ship after a long time. “Zheng Cheng didn’t mean to offend Lord Creation! Please forgive me!” </p>
			<p> Zheng Cheng was the name of the celestial emperor from the Zhusheng Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “Leave.” Zhu Yaowen ordered. </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord Creation!” </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, the Zhusheng Celestial Empire’s flying ship disappeared. </p>
			<p> “I’ll enter alone to capture Yu Long.” Huang Xiaolong addressed Ao Xing and Ao Meixia. “If you enter the Submerged Dragon Institute, Yu Long will probably pee his pants and run away!” </p>
			<p> “Alright. We’ll stand guard here. He won’t be able to escape.” Ao Xing chuckled.  </p>
			<p> He knew that Yu Long was extremely afraid of them. </p>
			<p> After sending Zhu Yaowen and the others to surround the Submerged Dragon Institute, Huang Xiaolong entered alone. </p>
			<p> When the disciples of the Submerged Dragon Institute wanted to approach him, they realized that none of them could move! </p>
			<p> Wherever Huang Xiaolong walked, everyone would be stuck in place. </p>
			<p> In the heart of the Submerged Dragon Institute, Yu Long was happily chatting with Xu Long and the others. </p>
			<p> Even though there was still some time till the start of the tournament, those who were supposed to come had already arrived. </p>
			<p> Xu Long chuckled, “Fellow Cultivator Yu Long, you became so much stronger these past few years. I'm no longer your match.” </p>
			<p> “Brother Xu Long is exaggerating. No matter how much I cultivate, I won’t be your opponent.” </p>
			<p> The two of them continued to give in to each other. 𝐟𝗿𝗲𝗲𝐰𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> When that was going down, one of the higher-ups of the institute charged into the hall. “Lord Director, someone barged into the institute! From what they say, it’s the long lost Huang Xiaolong!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3568 – How Can You Be Stronger Than The Star Dragon Couple?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “What?! Huang Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p> Yu Long, Xu Long, and the others were shocked. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s status as the Star Dragon Couple’s sworn brother was no longer a secret in the Star Dragon Universe. </p>
			<p> “Did anyone else come with him?!” Yu Long panicked. </p>
			<p> “No. He came alone.” </p>
			<p> Yu Long heaved a sigh of relief silently. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Xu Long’s eyes. When Huang Xiaolong relied on the Star Dragon Couple’s backing to capture Chu Huaihao in front of him, he was greatly embarrassed. The incident was still stinging his pride after all these years. </p>
			<p> “Go. Bring him here.” Yu Long ordered the expert who made the report. 𝙛𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord Director!”  </p>
			<p> Before the man could leave the hall, a voice echoed in their ears. “There’s no need for the trouble. I’m here.” </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong who was sauntering into the hall. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on Yu Long’s face and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, your position in the Submerged Dragon Institute has already been stripped! How dare you come back?!” </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that I won’t dare to do anything to you because of the Star Dragon Couple?!” </p>
			<p> Yu Long’s voice rang through the Submerged Dragon Institute. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored Yu Long as he swept his gaze across everyone in the hall. Huang Xiaolong saw Xu Long, Ao Wen, and other people he was familiar with. When he entered the Submerged Dragon Institute to look for the Star Dragon Essence, Ao Wen provided him with the news. </p>
			<p> Ao Wen lowered her head as she was too ashamed to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Yu Long’s expression sank when he noticed how Huang Xiaolong ignored him. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far!” Yu Long roared as he shattered the table beside him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared in the plaza outside the grand hall. “Yu Long, stop yelling like a dead dog. I’ll give you a chance to fight me!” </p>
			<p> Everyone in the Submerged Dragon Institute was shocked. </p>
			<p> Yu Long stared at Huang Xiaolong while questioning what he just heard. “Huang Xiaolong, did I hear that right?! Are you f*cking crazy?! Do you really think that you’re as strong as the Star Dragon Couple?!” </p>
			<p> One of the Gods of Creation at the grand completion stage in the Submerged Dragon Institute could no longer control his rage and he leaped to his feet. “Huang Xiaolong, even if the Star Dragon Couple comes today, I’ll teach you a lesson or two! Who the f*ck do you think you are?!” </p>
			<p> They wanted to teach Huang Xiaolong some manners! </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, he flew towards Huang Xiaolong. “Get down here right now! Get to your knees and apologize to Lord Yu Long!” </p>
			<p> A God of Creation at the grand completion stage was horrifyingly strong! The faces of those present changed, and the experts of the various factions fell to their knees. </p>
			<p> Just as everything thought that Huang Xiaolong would be beaten to the ground by the God of Creation, he casually waved his hand to nullify the attack coming his way. The God of Creation at the grand completion stage coughed a mouthful of blood. He was sent flying into the crowd and he crashed straight into Ao Wen of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire! </p>
			<p> Ao Wen failed to react in time and the blood of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage stained his body. Despite his status as a celestial emperor, he nearly fell to his knees in fright. </p>
			<p> The experts of the various celestial empires were paralysed with shock. </p>
			<p> They weren’t the only ones. Yu Long, Xu Long, and the various Gods of Creation present couldn’t believe their eyes. </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong’s disappearance, many people had been trying to guess how strong he had gotten. There were some who said that Huang Xiaolong entered the God of Creation Realm and he reached the small completion stage. Others said that he might have entered the large completion stage! A minority of them thought that Huang Xiaolong reached the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> No one expected him to reach the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> From what they saw, he wasn’t any weaker than Yu Long or Xu Long! Even if he hadn’t reached their level, he wasn’t too far off! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the God of Creation who was sent flying and he turned to Yu Long, “Yu Long, get up here. As the director of the Submerged Dragon Institute, you should behave like one. You can’t let your subordinate die on your behalf.” </p>
			<p> “Of course, it doesn’t matter if you come up here or not. The outcome of the battle is already decided.” </p>
			<p> His voice stabbed the dao souls of those present. </p>
			<p> Intentionally or unintentionally, the gazes of those present drifted to Yu Long. </p>
			<p> Reaching the limit of his patience, Yu Long roared with laughter as killing intent spewed from his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re too arrogant! I’ll show you the end of someone who doesn’t know his place!” </p>
			<p> “Even if I offend the Star Dragon Couple, I’ll teach you a lesson!” </p>
			<p> As soon as the words left his lips, he charged at Huang Xiaolong. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s palm emerged from the void beside him and slapped him senseless. Yu Long was sent flying as he crashed into the body of the first expert who moved against Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Silence descended on the lands as everyone looked at Yu Long who was defeated by a single slap! </p>

			<p> Blood trickled down Yu Long’s cheeks as his teeth scattered across the floor.  </p>
			<p> As for Ao Wen, he could no longer control himself as he fell to the ground and a wet patch stained his pants. </p>
			<p> “Was that what you wanted to teach me?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> Yu Long crawled to his feet as he suppressed the humiliation he felt. With fright filling his mind, he cried, “This… This isn’t possible! How are you stronger than the Star Dragon Couple?! This isn't possible!” </p>
			<p> If Huang Xiaolong was stronger than them, why would he need them to capture Chu Huaihao?! </p>
			<p> Yu Long was stuck in a state of disbelief and so was Xu Long. No one could believe that someone would be stronger than the Star Dragon Couple! </p>
			<p> “That’s because you don’t know how vast the universe is!” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> With a sudden roar, golden light emerged from Yu Long’s body. It illuminated the various spaces in the Submerged Dragon Institute and a staff appeared in his hand. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Staff was a top-grade creation artifact, and it was created from the most precious treasures in the Star Dragon Universe. There wasn’t a need to mention how strong it was! </p>
			<p> Unfortunately for him, his opponent was Huang Xiaolong. With a simple wave of his hand, he blocked the Dragon Staff that was crashing down on him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually flicked his wrist and sent Yu Long flying out once again.</p>

			</title>
			<p> Yu Long crashed into the ground before Ao Wen and the Dragon Staff clattered onto the ground close to them. </p>
			<p> With a simple gesture, Huang Xiaolong pulled the Dragon Staff over. </p>
			<p> “This isn’t too bad. I’ll accept it for now.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before wiping out the soul imprint on the Dragon Staff. When Yu Long saw what happened, he vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. No one knew if it was because of the damage to his soul or if it was because of the humiliation. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, you went too far!” Yu Long roared as he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong in desperation. </p>
			<p> Returning to his true form, a massive dragon blocked out the skies. His claws reached towards Huang Xiaolong, but they were swatted away by Huang Xiaolong’s palm. When a punch from Huang Xiaolong landed on Yu Long’s body, he was sent crashing through countless structures. </p>
			<p> “Going too far?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “I don’t think so.” </p>
			<p> Yu Long vomited mouthfuls of blood and he cursed, “Huang Xiaolong, you…” </p>
			<p> He wasn’t someone Huang Xiaolong could bully as he pleased… He was a god! He was a god standing at the peak of the thirteen universes! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared in front of Yu Long. “I was planning to teach you a lesson. However, I was asked to kill you.”  </p>
			<p> Asked?! </p>
			<p> Yu Long and those around stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. </p>
			<p> “Someone asked you to kill me?! How many treasures were you given?! I’ll double it!” Yu Long panicked. “I have a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein! There are other valuable treasures in the Submerged Dragon Institute!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong snickered, “I was indeed given a treasure. However, it’s worth more than a million top-grade universe spiritual veins!” </p>
			<p> What?! </p>
			<p> Worth more than a million top-grade universe-level spiritual veins?! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with Yu Long any longer as he sealed the man’s grand cosmos energy. He tossed him into the Sun Moon Furnace without another word. </p>
			<p> Turning to look at Xu Long, Xu Long’s expression changed drastically. He turned away, pretending to not know Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Xu Long, you must hate me for what I did, no?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong just arrived, Xu Long was indeed enraged. Now, he quickly shook his head and stuttered, “Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong must be kidding! Chu Huaihao went against Lord Huang on his own accord! He deserved to die! I forgot about everything that happened back then, how can I possibly blame you?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly before looking at the other experts present. </p>
			<p> Heaving a sigh of relief, Xu Long thought that Huang Xiaolong was going to let the matter rest. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s gaze soon returned to him. </p>
			<p> “Don’t you have several universe-level spiritual veins left?” </p>
			<p> Xu Long’s body froze as a bitter smile appeared on his face. </p>
			<p> “As the strongest celestial empire in the Star Dragon Universe, how can you not possess some?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> “No… No… Lord Huang Xiaolong, please don’t be mistaken. I used up a few of them along the way…” Xu Long explained. Retrieving whatever he had left, Xu Long handed them over to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord Huang, these are all that I have left.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stared at two high-grade universe spiritual veins, four mid-grade ones, and nodded. He turned to look at the other experts present. “What about you guys?” </p>
			<p> The Gods of Creation present felt their eyelids twitching slightly. </p>
			<p> “Relax. I’ll give you Star Dragon Scales in exchange.” Huang Xiaolong explained. He took out several dozen Star Dragon Scales after he spoke, illuminating the space with silvery starlight. </p>
			<p> The Gods of Creation who felt like they were about to get ripped off nearly danced in excitement. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Huang, are you serious?!” One of the experts at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm asked in disbelief. Just a second ago, they thought that Huang Xiaolong was about to rob them clean! </p>
			<p> “Of course!” </p>
			<p> The moment they received Huang Xiaolong’s promise, none of them hesitated to take out all the universe-level spiritual veins they had. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to rip them off either. He gave them the Star Dragon Scales according to the exchange rate in the First Universe. He was slightly taken aback by the amount of universe-level spiritual veins the Star Dragon Universe possessed. In the end, he managed to gather sixty of them from the Gods of Creation present. </p>
			<p> Since most of the experts in the God of Creation Realm came to the Submerged Dragon Institute's tournament, they saved Huang Xiaolong a great deal of trouble. </p>
			<p> Xu Long felt anger surging through his heart when he saw how everyone got their fair share of Star Dragon Scales in exchange for their spiritual veins. He was the only one who didn’t receive anything in return! Even so, he wouldn’t dare to bring up his dissatisfaction to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> After obtaining the spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with them. He turned around to leave. </p>
			<p> It remained eerily silent as Huang Xiaolong left the plaza. </p>
			<p> Entering the treasury of the Submerged Dragon Institute, Huang Xiaolong swept everything into the Sun Moon Furnace. The guarding elder of the treasury could only weep sadly at the side while watching Huang Xiaolong’s merciless pillaging. </p>
			<p> After he was done, Huang Xiaolong approached the Dragon Eye Cliff. Like how he entered before, he went to the mysterious space to look for the consciousness of the Star Dragon Universe. </p>
			<p> Seeing Huang Xiaolong again, the Star Dragon Universe was beyond shocked. </p>
			<p> “You… You… You have already accumulated 14.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy!” It quickly discovered Huang Xiaolong’s strength. </p>
			<p> “Yes.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Senior Star Dragon, I promised to kill Yu Long for you previously. I have already captured him.” After he said his piece, he released Yu Long from the Sun Moon Furnace.  </p>
			<p> Yu Long started to panic when he saw the space he was in. 𝓯𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝒃𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>

			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, where the hell is this?! What do you want?!” Yu Long roared. </p>
			<p> “Don’t you know where this is?!” The Star Dragon Universe’s voice boomed in Yu Long’s ears. </p>
			<p> “You… Star Dragon Universe?!” Yu Long yelped. </p>
			<p> “It’s good that you still remember my voice.” </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, release me, please release me!” Yu Long turned around to grab Huang Xiaolong’s legs and he pleaded. </p>
			<p> Ignoring Yu Long, Huang Xiaolong turned to the Star Dragon Universe. “Senior Star Dragon, I wish to inquire about some other matters now that I am here.” </p>
			<p> He asked several questions about the Unknown Lands and the thirteen universes. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Universe was shocked to hear Huang Xiaolong’s question on the Unknown Lands. A sigh entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears. “I don’t know much about the Unknown Lands as I am unable to leave the Star Dragon Universe, but I can be sure of one thing…”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3570 – Giant Palm&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “The Unknown Lands is definitely left behind since the ancient era!” The Star Dragon Universe explained. </p>
			<p> “Left behind since the ancient era…” Huang Xiaolong felt his soul trembling slightly. </p>
			<p> There were countless rumors going around in the First Universe. The Unknown Lands belonging to an ancient era was one of them. With the Star Dragon Universe’s confirmation, it seemed as though the rumors were true! </p>
			<p> “Yes…” The Star Dragon Universe became serious. “In fact, the thirteen universes were destroyed once before.” </p>
			<p> “What?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. Other than the universes themselves, every single living creature was destroyed. Countless Gods of Creation fell…” </p>
			<p> “Why?” Huang Xiaolong’s confusion was summed up in a single word. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Universe sighed slowly, “No one knows the reason, not even myself. It seems as though there is a power stronger than the Thirteen Universes combined…” </p>
			<p> “Was the thirteen universes destroyed by someone?!” Huang Xiaolong was stuck in a state of disbelief. “This… Did a Universe God do this?! There shouldn’t be a Universe God born in the various universes you…”  </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Universe muttered, “There hasn’t been a Universe God since the start of time. However, there are existences comparable to it.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt his heart pounding in his chest. </p>
			<p> Existences comparable to a Universe God? </p>
			<p> The very concept of a Universe God was terrifying! An existence like that could control the various universes with a single thought! </p>
			<p> “There is no need to worry. Even if an existence like that is present, he is not a true Universe God. He doesn’t have the clairvoyance and control a Universe God has. At the very most, he has the ability to control space and time at an extraordinary level. You are a miracle who created three great worlds. It’s only a matter of time before you surpass him.” The Star Dragon Universe explained. </p>
			<p> Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong finally heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> “When the thirteen universes were destroyed previously, a majority of the experts died. However, there were some terrifyingly strong ones who banded together to resist the destructive energy.” </p>
			<p> “There were experts capable of doing that?” Huang Xiaolong gasped. </p>
			<p> Even though they worked together, it was proof that they were extremely strong! </p>
			<p> “The seniors who did that possessed supreme strength! They managed to reverse the yin and yang and they carved out a space for themselves. Hiding in there, they managed to avoid destruction.” The Star Dragon Universe continued. </p>
			<p> “Is that… Is that the space located in the depths of the Unknown Lands?” Huang Xiaolong guessed. </p>
			<p> “That is correct. However, they are unable to leave the Unknown Lands despite transcending destruction. The moment they leave, they will face the extermination tribulations.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt a heavy weight lifted off his chest after hearing what the Star Dragon Universe Said. </p>
			<p> If those experts could leave the Unknown Space, the thirteen universes would definitely be thrown into turmoil! </p>
			<p> After all, they could resist the power meant to destroy the thirteen universes! Creating a space on their own, one could only imagine how strong they were! 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts turned to the Dragon Overlord who was backing Meng Tian and Huang Sheng. Could he be an expert from the ancient era?! </p>
			<p> “They might be unable to leave, but what about other experts?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Their descendants should be able to.”  </p>
			<p> “Senior Star Dragon, do you know how many people survived during the destruction of the thirteen universes?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> “This… I have no idea. There might be slightly more than a dozen of them…” The Star Dragon Universe replied. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> Every single one of them should be a monstrous freak. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong changed his line of questioning to the thirteen universes. He wanted to know if there were natural worlds or regions where he could increase his strength. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Universe might have lived for a long time, but it couldn’t leave! It had no idea what went on in the other universes, and Huang Xiaolong could only search for clues on his own. </p>
			<p> Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong left the Dragon Eye Cliff. </p>
			<p> Yu Long was naturally left behind, and with his grand cosmos energy sealed, he would never be able to leave. </p>
			<p> Despite the very obvious grudge between the Star Dragon Universe and Yu Long, Huang Xiaolong managed to suppress his curiosity. </p>
			<p> When he emerged from the Submerged Dragon Institute, the Star Dragon Couple approached him immediately. </p>
			<p> “Now, you’re the most famous expert in the Star Dragon Universe!” Ao Xing roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> “Should we head over to the Bearded Dragon World to eat some Fire Bugs?” Huang Xiaolong suggested. </p>
			<p> Jumping in excitement, Starly roared, “Alright! That’s a great idea!” </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple looked at each other and chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> After arriving at the Bearded Dragon World, Huang Xiaolong and the three dragons ate their fill. When they were done, Huang Xiaolong bade his farewell and returned to the First Universe. </p>
			<p> Since Meng Tian, Huang Sheng, and Yu Long were dealt with, the only thing left was the alliance between the Creation Palace and the Eternal Heaven Alliance. Once he was done with them, he could enter seclusion in peace. He would prepare himself to enter the Unknown Lands! </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Couple thought of going back to the First Universe with Huang Xiaolong, but they were stopped by him. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he could easily suppress Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong even if they worked together. With the three of them gone, their alliance was headed for destruction. </p>
			<p> Several months later, Huang Xiaolong led Zhu Yaowen and the others back to their home base in the First Universe.  </p>
			<p> “Your Highness, you’re back!” Wang Zaixu and the others cheered when he returned. Even though they were given full control over the faction, Huang Xiaolong’s absence meant that their strongest expert was gone! There were lots of trouble they had to deal with! </p>
			<p> “Did anything happen in the years I left?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Wang Zaixu looked at Jiang Hong and they started to hesitate. </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong eventually broke the silence, “Nothing happened thus far, but they seem to be gathering their strength now. It seems as though they found some sort of support.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Oh?” </p>
			<p> Did they receive some sort of support from the Unknown Space? </p>
			<p> Someone paid a visit to Huang Xiaolong the very next day, and he was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. He was called Chen Bi, and he claimed to be from the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> “Your lord is inviting me over to the Creation Palace?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Chen Bi grinned. “Our lord has arrived in the First Universe and when he heard about the misunderstanding between all of you, he decided to be the mediator. He wishes for all of you to settle your difference amicably.”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3571 – Zhu Qiming&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Settling this matter amicably with them?!” Jiang Hong flew into a fit of rage instantly. “What if we refuse?! Who the hell do you think you are to order His Highness to settle things peacefully?!” </p>
			<p> Even though Chen Bi appeared all friendly, his tone was full of contempt. No one in Huang Xiaolong’s faction could suppress their anger. </p>
			<p> A frosty light flashed through Chen Bi’s eyes in response. “Are you Jiang Hong of the Solitary Alliance? Humph, do you really think that you’re impressive with your strength at the half step Universe Realm? Our lord possesses strength beyond your wildest imagination! Killing you will be as easy as breathing!” </p>
			<p> “As for our ancestor, you won’t be able to imagine how strong he really is! Haha! You’re not even fit to be the ancestor’s slave!” </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong felt anger surging in his heart, but Huang Xiaolong stopped him with a single gesture. </p>
			<p> Turning to Chen Bi, Huang Xiaolong said, “I’ll accept the invitation. Tomorrow, we can head over to the Creation Palace together.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong and the others were shocked to hear that Huang Xiaolong’s agreement. </p>
			<p> Chen Bi’s expression relaxed and a smile eventually formed on his face. “Seems like fellow cultivator Huang knows what’s good for him!” Turning to Jiang Hong, he sneered, “Unlike someone over here.”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive and he sent Zhu Yaowen to arrange the details with Chen Bi. </p>
			<p> After sending Chen Bi away, Jiang Hong could’t hold himself back and he asked Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, this is definitely a trap laid down by the Creation Palace! It’s too dangerous for us to attend the meeting…” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! Your Highness, they chose to hold the banquet in the Creation Palace, and they might have already come to an agreement with Kun Feng and the others.” Wang Zaixu continued. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and chuckled, “It’s alright. Regardless of where they hold it, the outcome is the same.” </p>
			<p> It didn’t matter what they were scheming. In the face of absolute power, no tricks would work! </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s strength at 14.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, he wasn’t afraid of any trap they would set! </p>
			<p> We are FreeWebNovel.com, find us on google. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. From what Chen Bi said, their ancestor was likely a supreme expert in the Unknown Lands. It seemed as though the lord who was inviting him over was a descendant of the supreme expert. </p>
			<p> To be able to deal with an expert at Jiang Hong’s level easily, they would probably possess 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy. With Kun Feng’s understanding of his strength, they would only be confident enough to invite Huang Xiaolong over if the expert had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> A sneer left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. It was a shame that none of them knew about Huang Xiaolong’s current strength. </p>
			<p> Of course, it didn't hurt to be careful. Huang Xiaolong might be fearless, but it didn’t hurt to make some preparations. Huang Xiaolong gathered five hundred experts to follow him over to the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> All five hundred of them were carefully chosen by Huang Xiaolong. Even though there were only five hundred of them, their collective strength was double that of the experts in the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> As the night passed uneventfully, Huang Xiaolong met Chen Bi in the morning to head over. </p>
			<p> They used the Xuan Hong Flying Ship to rush over to the Creation Palace as it was faster than whatever Chen Bi came in. </p>
			<p> “Fellow Cultivator Huang, this flying ship should belong to Xuan Hong of the Creation Palace, right?” A look of interest appeared on Chen Bi’s face. </p>
			<p> Chen Bi definitely knew how strong Huang Xiaolong was. Despite that, he refused to address Huang Xiaolong properly. It seemed as though he was still trying to put on airs in front of everyone present. </p>
			<p> Moreover, he pointed out that the flying ship belonged to Xuan Hong of the Creation Palace. Reading between the lines, he was trying to say that Huang Xiaolong was a petty bandit. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “That’s right. However, it’s mine now.” He casually slapped the body of the ship and continued, “I’ll refine it again in a little and turn it into my very own Blue Dragon Flying Ship.” 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> That was his actual plan. </p>
			<p> When he dealt with the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance, he would use all the treasures they had to refine the Xuan Hong Flying Ship. While he was at it, he would increase the power of the ship again. </p>
			<p> With his current strength, he was more than capable of doing so. </p>
			<p> Chen Bi roared with laughter when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Haha! It’s not easy to do what you just said. Looks like you’re pretty rich!” </p>
			<p> “After capturing Kai Dong and Xuan Hong, I have all the treasures I need.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> Snickering at the side, Chen Bi chose to remain silent. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Chen Bi tried to hold a conversation with Huang Xiaolong but he was quickly brushed off with a few sentences. </p>
			<p> From what they talked about, Huang Xiaolong learned that the person backing Chen Bi up was called Zhu Qiming. Due to Chen Bi’s refusal to reveal any more information, Huang Xiaolong only knew that Zhu Qiming was from the Unknown Lands.  </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was traveling towards the Creation Palace, Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong were standing respectfully before Zhu Qiming. </p>
			<p> “We will have to rely on Lord Zhu Qiming to capture Huang Xiaolong.” Kun Feng bowed. </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming snorted, “Relax. There is no way he can escape. If he chooses to submit to my Zhu Family, I’ll leave it at that. If he refuses, I have no choice but to eliminate him.” </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen hesitated for a second and said, “Huang Xiaolong has the Star Dragon Divine Tree… It might not be as easy to deal with him as we think!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming waved his sleeves and sneered, “So what! He won’t be able to escape anyway. Lord Mei Jie has been accepted into my ancestor’s service. He told me to relay a message. He’s doing extremely well in the Unknown Lands. There’s no need for you to miss him.” </p>
			<p> “Yes…” Kun Feng and the others bowed in succession. </p>
			<p> “The reason I came to the First Universe is to locate the universe sphere orb and the cosmos orb. All of you control a huge part of the First Universe, and if you manage to locate it, our ancestor will reward you greatly.” </p>
			<p> Kun Feng and the rest bowed yet again. </p>
			<p> Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong arrived in the Creation Palace.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3572 – Kneel&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong arrived, he saw Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong. Zhu Qiming was nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong’s expression sank. “Where’s Zhu Qiming?” </p>
			<p> Lin Tong sneered in contempt, “Lord Zhu Qiming isn’t someone you can meet as you wish! Do you really think he will welcome you in person?” </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Chen Yizhen continued, “It’s more than enough for the three of us to welcome you.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Hong wanted to continue, but he was cut short by Huang Xiaolong. “Lead the way.” </p>
			<p> Kun Feng shot a glance at Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong before bringing him towards the depths of the Creation Palace. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Qiming has already prepared a grand banquet. However, he only wishes to meet you. Huagn Xiaolong, leave all of them out here.” Kun Feng said. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Wang Zaixu and the others felt their expressions sinking.  </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t care much about it. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on Kun Feng’s face when he heard how easily Huang Xiaolong agreed. However, he didn’t say anything about it. </p>
			<p> Several moments later, they arrived at the main hall of the Creation Palace and Huang Xiaolong got the rest to wait outside. </p>
			<p> When he was brought into the main hall by the three of them, the gates slammed shut. The grand formation activated and surrounded the main hall. </p>
			<p> Wang Zaixu and the others wanted to charge into the hall to help Huang Xiaolong, but they were stopped by the strong barrier. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, go ahead.” Kun Feng sneered in the hall and he gestured into the hall. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong strolled in nonchalantly. </p>
			<p> As the main hall was massive, it took some time for them to arrive in the depths of the hall. </p>
			<p> When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong saw a youngster who had a majestic aura around him. Clad in crimson robes, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was looking at Zhu Qiming for the very first time. </p>
			<p> He also noticed that a middle aged expert was standing behind Zhu Qiming. The middle-aged expert might look extremely ordinary, but the aura he emitted told Huang Xiaolong that he had more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Qiming.” Kun Feng and the rest were extremely respectful. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Qiming indifferently. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, why aren’t you greeting Lord Zhu Qiming?” The middle-aged man behind Zhu Qiming snorted. As the words left his lips, it was as though a clap of thunder boomed in everyone's ears.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Why should I be greeting him? He should be the one welcoming me.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming waved his hand to stop the middle-aged expert behind him from jumping out. “Huang Xiaolong, I won’t beat about the bush with you. The Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance chose to serve my Zhu Family. Surrender now and release Kai Dong and Xuan Hong. Kneel to accept me as your master.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming spoke casually, but his words were like an imperial decree. </p>
			<p> “Kneel? Surrender? Release Kai Dong and Xuan Hong?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Qiming like he was looking at a clown. “Are you actually stupid?” </p>
			<p> Kun Feng and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong, happy to watch him make a fool of himself. Indeed, Zhu Qiming’s expression sank. 𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝒃𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> The middle-aged expert behind Zhu Qiming growled in anger, “How dare you!” </p>
			<p> Rushing towards Huang Xiaolong with his outstretched hands, lightning surrounded the hall instantly. </p>
			<p> The lightning he summoned contained a terrifying amount of energy. However, Huang Xiaolong’s arm pierced through the sea of lightning and a punch landed on the middle aged man’s chest. Casually swinging his arm, Huang Xiaolong tossed the man to the side of the hall like he was nothing more than hot garbage. </p>
			<p> Kun Feng and the rest stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. The middle-aged man might have hidden his strength, but they knew how strong he actually was! Even if they worked together, they wouldn’t be able to hold him down in battle! He had 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but he was sent flying all the same! </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming was equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> “You… Don’t you have 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy?” Zhu Qiming’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive as he muttered, “Did you hear about my strength from these dumb*sses?” </p>
			<p> Kun Feng and the rest felt their intestines turning green when they heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed them, but they knew that they wouldn’t be able to do a thing after Huang Xiaolong revealed his strength earlier.  </p>
			<p> Getting up from his seat, Zhu Qiming slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong. He released his aura completely and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong you surprised me time and time again. Looks like you have 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy…” </p>
			<p> “... Hahaha! Too bad that’s the extent of your strength! Today, you will kneel and surrender to me!” </p>
			<p> Releasing his grand cosmos energy, the space in the hall started to twist from the sheer pressure. </p>
			<p> Zhu Qiming had 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> From what it seemed, he had barely broken through to that level. </p>
			<p> “Kneel!” Zhu Qiming pressed his palm down, and a frightening pressure descended from the void. </p>
			<p> With 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, there wasn’t a need to mention experts at the grand completion stage. Even Kun Feng would be crushed to bits! </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong greeted Zhu Qiming’s palm with a punch of his own. Punching upwards, a blue dragon tore through the skies to shatter Zhu Qiming’s attack. Before he could react, Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed on his jaws. </p>
			<p> The sound of bone shattering filled the air and the blue dragon tore through the roof of the main hall. A giant hole was formed. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air and stomped on Zhu Qiming’s chest, sending him face planting into the ground.</p>

			</title>
			<p> Zhu Qiming slammed into the ground unceremoniously. </p>
			<p> Outside the main hall, the experts of the Eternal Heaven Alliance and Creation Palace were staring coldly at Wang Zaixu and the others when they heard a loud crash. Raising their heads, they were greeted with the sight of Zhu Qiming’s face getting kicked in. </p>
			<p> When Zhu Qiming crashed into the hall, Chen Bi and the others stared blankly behind them. </p>
			<p> “That… Was that Lord Zhu Qiming?” The experts of the Creation Palace asked. </p>
			<p> Chen Bi slapped him instinctively. “How can that be Lord Zhu Qiming?!” </p>
			<p> A giant palm print could be seen on the expert’s face. </p>
			<p> When you're just trying to make great content at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Unable to retaliate, the expert could only laugh it off. “That’s right… How can that be Lord Zhu Qiming?”  </p>
			<p> However, he was sure he saw Zhu Qiming crashing into the main hall earlier. </p>
			<p> Inside, Huang Xiaolong stared at Zhu Qiming who had a giant dent in his face. </p>
			<p> Zhi Qiming was too careless when facing Huang Xiaolong. Otherwise, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could have dealt with him so easily. After all, their strength didn’t defer too much as Huang Xiaolong wasn’t using the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong decided to end the battle as soon as possible. Summoning the Star Dragon Divine Tree, countless roots appeared and sent Zhu Qiming flying once again. He wasn’t going to give his opponent the chance to breathe. </p>
			<p> After all, it was possible for Zhu Qiming to escape given his strength. </p>
			<p> When the roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree landed on his body, wounds could be seen reaching into his bones. </p>
			<p> Roaring with rage, a giant sword appeared in the skies above Zhu Qiming and it slashed downwards at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, you’ll die miserably!” Killing intent leaked from his eyes. </p>
			<p> The giant sword surpassed any top-grade creation artifact they knew. When it appeared, space itself was sliced into bits. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree instantly. With the branches forming a giant wall before him, a defensive barrier was created to stop the giant sword from Zhu Qiming. All of a sudden, Zhu Qiming saw four mysterious flames appearing on the crown of the tree. </p>
			<p> The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Tortoise leaped at Zhu Qiming in unison. </p>
			<p> Turning pale, Zhu Qiming couldn’t dodge in time as the White Tiger Flame crashed into him. The smell of burnt flesh filled the air. </p>
			<p> “This… This is the four Universe Origin Fires!” Zhu Qiming roared in disbelief. </p>
			<p> Among the thirteen universes, one would be extremely lucky if they managed to obtain a single universe treasure! They didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to possess both the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the four Universe Origin Fires! </p>
			<p> When he was stuck in a state of shock, the Star Dragon Divine Tree swept its branches towards him again and he was sent crashing deep into the earth. </p>
			<p> The formation around the main hall of the Creation Palace was shattered by the impact. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> An hour later, Huang Xiaolong dragged the ragged Zhu Qiming towards himself. </p>
			<p> Taking shallow breaths, Zhu Qiming glared at Huang Xiaolong and threatened, “Huang Xiaolong, I am the grand prince of the Zhu Family! The great ancestor will never let you off!” </p>
			<p> “We’ll talk when he can leave the Unknown Space.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “You… How do you know?!” Zhu Qiming’s eyes widened. </p>
			<p> “I wouldn’t dare to kill you if I didn’t know.” Huang Xiaolong snorted. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong searched through Zhu Qiming’s soul. To his surprise, Zhu Qiming had two great worlds like Mei Jie! However, he didn’t understand why Zhu Qiming only had 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy despite being at the half step Universe God Realm. 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> After careful inspection, a frown formed on his face. Zhu Qiming only managed to create his second great world after entering the half step Universe God Realm. That was the reason behind the disparity in grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> A commotion broke out outside the main hall when Huang Xiaolong was still thinking about Zhu Qiming’s lack of strength. As it turned out, Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong tried to escape when they realized that things went horribly wrong. They were stopped by Jiang Hong and the others.  </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong tossed Zhu Qiming into the Sun Moon Furnace, he strolled out of the main hall and looked at the battle that was taking place. </p>
			<p> Kun Feng and the rest might be half step Universe Gods, they were up against five hundred experts on Huang Xiaolong’s side! They were unable to escape even after giving it their all. </p>
			<p> Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had emerged, their expressions changed instantly. They didn’t expect him to deal with Zhu Qiming so quickly! If he was strong enough to capture Zhu Qiming in such a short amount of time, wouldn’t that mean that… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the panicked expression on their faces and a sneer formed on his lips. He appeared in front of them instantly, but he was met with an enraged cry. “Huang Xiaolong, what have you done to Lord Zhu Qiming?! Release him right now! Otherwise, you’ll regret your decision!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stared at Chen Bi who was charging towards him and shattered the man’s bones into dust. Sealing Chen Bi’s grand cosmos energy, he threw him into the Sun Moon Furnace to reunite with Zhu Qiming. When he was done, he turned to look at Kun Feng’s trio. </p>
			<p> Before coming, he instructed Jiang Hong and the rest to never let Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong escape no matter what. As such, they bore the brunt of the attacks. Eventually, they were captured and sealed by Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Seeing the three of them falling into the enemy’s hands, the experts of the Creation Palace and the Eternal Heaven Alliance lost all fighting spirit. Those who ran, ran. There were also many who fell to their knees to surrender. In several short minutes, the once glorious Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance ceased to exist. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong told Jiang Hong and the others to clean up the battlefield before heading over to the treasury. Breaking open the restrictions by force, he swept everything clean. </p>
			<p> No matter what, the Creation Palace had been the strongest power in the First Universe for countless years. The amount of treasures they accumulated wasn’t something imaginable by ordinary experts. The treasures that were stacked into planet-sized mountains entered the Sun Moon Furnace and a satisfied smile could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face.</p>

			</title>
			<p> The various precious ores and spiritual stones were secondary as Huang Xiaolong only cared about universe-level spiritual veins. Counting twenty-four of them in total, there was only a single one at the top-grade level! </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong dug out the treasury of the Eternal Heaven Alliance from Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong. Due to his wanton trading of universe-level spiritual veins for Star Dragon Scales previously, there were only several strands of universe-level spiritual veins left in there. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was slightly disappointed, but there wasn’t much he could do. From the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s treasury and the treasury of the Creation Palace, there were less than a hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> “Forget it. It’ll have to do for now.” Huang Xiaolong sighed silently in his heart. </p>
			<p> After the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance submitted to him, Huang Xiaolong ordered Jiang Hong and the others to search for information on universe-level spiritual veins in the First Universe. After passing down his order, he entered seclusion immediately. </p>
			<p> This time, Huang Xiaolong took nearly four hundred thousand years and he reached the 15 billion units mark. </p>
			<p> Not only did he refine all the spiritual veins he had, he also strengthened the Xuan Hong Flying Ship with the resources in the treasuries. Now, it has reached a whole new level of power! He also transformed it to the Blue Dragon Flying Ship that fit his needs. </p>
			<p> The Blue Dragon Flying Ship was a notch stronger than the Xuan Hong Flying Ship. A blue dragon diagram was inlaid on the body of the ship, and it contained a supreme formation created by Huang Xiaolong. The souls of Huang Sheng and Ao Wanshan were sealed in the formation as the formation spirit!  </p>
			<p> As Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, one could only imagine how strong the formation spirit was! </p>
			<p> Other than the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong also raised the Sun and Moon Furnace to the top-grade creation artifact level. He no longer bothered with the Purple Lightning Peak now that he had the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. After all, the Blue Dragon Flying Ship far surpassed the top-grade creation artifact level. Instead of wasting more time to refine the Purple Lightning Peak, he would rather comprehend the mysteries of the universe in the Universe Sphere. </p>
			<p> After leaving seclusion, Huang Xiaolong asked about the situation in the First Universe. </p>
			<p> Wang Zaixu, Jiang Hong, and the others made their reports in succession. </p>
			<p> Due to the destruction of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance, the unification of the First Universe didn’t meet with much obstruction. </p>
			<p> Now, Huang Xiaolong was the sole ruler of the First Universe! </p>
			<p> The only problem came when Huang Xiaolong asked about universe-level spiritual veins. After stuttering for some time, Jiang Hong revealed that no matter how hard they tried to look for universe-level spiritual veins, they could only find slightly more than a dozen. </p>
			<p> As for naturally formed worlds, there wasn’t news on it at all! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong expected as much before leaving seclusion, and he wasn’t too disappointed by the discovery. </p>
			<p> As night fell, Huang Xiaolong released the souls of Zhu Qiming and the middle aged expert who came along with him. He inspected the second great world in their bodies and conducted another soul search on them. </p>
			<p> He was shocked to discover that the middle aged expert didn’t possess a second great world! However, it was true that he managed to gather 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy! After looking at it for a long time, Huang Xiaolong finally discovered the difference between the great world he created. </p>
			<p> Compared to other experts at the half step Universe God Realm, his great world was much denser! If the great worlds of other experts were like a plastic ball, the great world of the middle aged man was made out of metal! </p>
			<p> Moreover, his grand cosmos energy shone a faint golden color compared to others. </p>
			<p> That was probably the reason behind his excessive combat strength! Huang Xiaolong gasped after he made the discovery. The man didn’t have 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but he had 12 billion units of combat strength! </p>
			<p> It was no wonder half step Universe Gods were so weak! Huang Xiaolong only had 1 more question in mind. How in the world did he cultivate to such a level? </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Searching through their souls, he discovered that it was no different from the others. Restrictions protected their core memories, and Huang Xiaolong was unable to learn a thing. He didn’t know how they managed to transform their great worlds and grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> “Speak. What did you do to your great world and your grand cosmos energy?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> A sneer left the middle-aged man’s lips. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really want to know? Go ask our ancestor! Hahaha! He will definitely take pity on you and teach you our ways!” </p>
			<p> “Alright. It doesn’t matter. I’ll make a trip over to the Unknown Lands anyway. I’ll learn all the same.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Since he wasn’t going to get an answer, he threw them back into the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> Several months later, Huang Xiaolong left the First Universe. </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> He came from the Blazing Dragon Universe, and he went to the Meng Tian Universe, Star Dragon Universe, and the First Universe. There were nine other universes he had never been to. If all the universes were similar to the four he had been to, he would be able to locate more naturally formed great worlds and universe-level spiritual veins! Huang Xiaolong believed that he would be able to grow stronger once again. </p>
			<p> Before leaving the First Universe, Huang Xiaolong started to take his precautions against the experts of the Unknown Lands. He laid down countless formations and he taught Wang Zaixu, Jiang Hong, and several others a set of special techniques.  </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong went to tour the nine universes in search of treasures. Along the way, he continued to comprehend the mysteries of the universe, and by the time he was done, more than two million years had passed. </p>
			<p> In the time he was away, he managed to find more than a dozen naturally formed great worlds! It was too bad there weren’t many universe-level spiritual veins to be found. Huang Xiaolong only managed to gather one hundred strands after scouring the universes, and he didn’t manage to find many high-grade ones, much less top-grade ones. </p>
			<p> When he was done, Huang Xiaolong managed to accumulate 17.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> When he returned, Jiang Hong and the others were shocked by his transformation. </p>
			<p> After hearing their reports, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Unknown Lands didn’t send anyone to the First Universe in the time he was gone. </p>
			<p> “No one?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> Since Zhu Qiming went missing, he fully expected the Zhu Family to send several experts over to look for their young master. </p>
			<p> Did something happen to the Zhu Family for them to remain impassive?! 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝓃𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself, “Looks like it’s time to take a look at the Unknown Lands…”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3575 – I’ll Save Your Father&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong had exhausted the resources in the thirteen universe and he could only head over to the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was planning to go, Wang Zaixu and the others requested to follow along. </p>
			<p> However, they were rejected by Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “How long will it be before you come back?” Jiang Shaoyu asked softly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “I have no idea how long it will take. However, I promise you, I’ll come back in ten million years.” </p>
			<p> Regardless of his progress in the Unknown Lands, Huang Xiaolong decided to make a trip back to the First Universe. </p>
			<p> “You have to take care of yourself…” Jiang Shaoyu reminded him once again. </p>
			<p> “I will.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he left on the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. Several months later, he finally arrived at the entrance of the Unknown Lands.  </p>
			<p> Even though Zhu Qiming and the others knew how to enter and exit the Unknown Lands, Huang Xiaolong was unable to discover the method despite the repeated soul searches. He could only use the most primitive method to enter, and that was by tearing through the layers of restrictions. </p>
			<p> Arriving at the place that stopped him previously, Huang Xiaolong tore through the restrictions that stopped him dead in his tracks before. With his newfound strength, the restrictions were like paper. </p>
			<p> Keeping the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong flew through space alone. Even without the flying ship, his speed was terrifying. </p>
			<p> Two months passed, and Huang Xiaolong finally tore through the final restriction stopping him from entering. He entered a vast space that contained somewhat different space laws from the thirteen universes. That was the only difference as everything looked similar. </p>
			<p> The spiritual energy that filled the air was extremely pure and refreshing. </p>
			<p> The Unknown Lands seemed to be paradise compared to the thirteen universes. </p>
			<p> Releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Unknown Lands was bigger than he had thought! </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, he felt the Universe Sphere trembling slightly. </p>
			<p> Was that the Universe Boat? Huang Xiaolong felt a surge of joy filling his heart. </p>
			<p> The feeling disappeared for more than half a month since he broke the restrictions around the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> As he flew towards the feeling, he crossed cities after cities. Crossing god knew how many continents, the feeling disappeared. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned as he tried to stimulate the Universe Sphere again, only to receive no reaction whatsoever. </p>
			<p> Unwilling to give up, Huang Xiaolong tried several more times. He only gave up after dozens of attempts. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in his eyes. Since the reaction stopped, the Universe Boat should be somewhere close. </p>
			<p> After releasing his dao souls to search the entire area, he failed to find a thing. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat wasn’t an object one could find whenever he liked. If it was that easy, it would have been gone a long time ago. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t anxious in the slightest. </p>
			<p> A moment later, he flew towards one of the cities in the area. </p>
			<p> “Falling Water City…” Huang Xiaolong read the giant sign hanging on the city gates. </p>
			<p> Looking at the walls, Huang Xiaolong could see the etchings of time along the city walls. It seemed to have existed for eternity. </p>
			<p> Even though the city was large, not too many people left the city. There weren’t many people entering either. From the looks of it, there were several guards standing along the city gates, but they didn’t question anyone entering. It wasn’t difficult for Huang Xiaolong to enter. </p>
			<p> Looking at the structures that surrounded him, Huang Xiaolong discovered that they weren’t as old as he had thought. They had a charm of their own. </p>
			<p> Even though the city was vast, there weren’t too many people walking about. There was an air of lethargy surrounding the city, and everyone seemed extremely idle. </p>
			<p> Slowing his steps, Huang Xiaolong enjoyed the scenery as he walked along the streets. </p>
			<p> Along his way, a little girl ran towards him and grabbed him by the thigh. She cried, “Lord, please, I beg you. Please save my father! The members of the Zhang Family are about to kill him! Please, please save him!” </p>
			<p> The little girl was nine at most, and she was extremely likable. Tears streamed down her face as she begged Huang Xiaolong again and again. </p>
			<p> Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t believe what he was hearing. </p>
			<p> “Little girl, please get up.” Huang Xiaolong lifted her off the ground gently. “Where is your father right now? Why are the members of the Zhang Family trying to kill him?” </p>
			<p> Rubbing her eyes slowly, the little girl continued, “They set him up! They said that he stole the physique spiritual jade belonging to their family, and they said that they would beat him up till they found it! He was vomiting blood when I ran away, and if this keeps up, they will kill him!” </p>
			<p> “I begged many people, and none of them agreed to save my father!” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to panic. Bring me there right now. I’ll save your father.” Huang Xiaolong dried her face and placed her down on the floor slowly. </p>
			<p> She grabbed his hand and ran off instantly.  </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before they arrived at one of the ancient courtyards located in the city. It was dilapidated, and it seemed inhabitable. However, whimpering could be heard in one of the rooms within. </p>
			<p> “Beat him up! Beat him harder!” Someone yelled. “Old Man Tao, if you refuse to hand it over, I’ll beat you to death and hang your body on the city walls. No one will dare to take revenge for you.” </p>
			<p> “Father!” The little girl ran into the room and screamed. </p>
			<p> Following behind her, Huang Xiaolong saw five men surrounding a skinny old man. They were beating him mercilessly, and his identity was clear in a single glance. He was the father of the little girl. </p>
			<p> Casually swinging his sleeves, he sent the members of the Zhang Family flying. </p>

			<p> Including the young man who was ordering them to hit the old man harder, they crashed into a corner of the courtyard. 𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> The sudden change caused the little girl’s father to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> “Father, I begged this lord to save you!” </p>
			<p> The members of the Zhang Family crawled to their feet and the young man yelled at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, you’re asking to die! How dare you interfere in the matters of our Zhang Family?!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3576 – Shopping&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Tightening his fist, Huang Xiaolong dragged the young man over to himself. A miserable shriek rang through the air as Huang Xiaolong snapped his fingers. </p>
			<p> “Caretaker Yun!” One of the other members yelled and charged at Huang Xiaolong. He was sent flying before he could come close. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the members of the Zhang Family and he looked at the person before him. “Do you really think your Zhang Family is something special?” </p>
			<p> The man he spoke to didn’t reply. Instead, he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. Casually twisting the man’s wrist, Huang Xiaolong snapped it directly. A miserable squeal broke through the air once again. </p>
			<p> “Hurry up and release me! Otherwise, you won’t be able to walk out of Falling Water City alive!” Caretaker Yun screamed as he rolled around on the ground. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed when he heard the threats directed at him. Grabbing Caretaker Yun’s hand, he twisted it one more round and pain surged through the man’s body. Killing intent leaked from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, wanting nothing more than to skin him alive. However, he no longer threw threats at Huang Xiaolong. 𝐟𝐫𝗲𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗻𝐨𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝐨𝗺</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered and he twisted Caretaker Yun’s hand yet another round. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord… Please, let me off! I won’t do it again!” </p>
			<p> “You haven’t answered me yet. Is your Zhang Family really impressive or something?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.  </p>
			<p> Afraid that Huang Xiaolong would continue his torture, Caretaker Yun yelled, “We are part of the four strongest families in the Falling Water City! Our ancestor is a Primal Ancestor! Even the city lord doesn’t dare to offend us!” </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but a grin soon formed on his face. “Here I thought you had some supreme expert in your family. As it turns out, you only have a Primal Ancestor.” Huang Xiaolong sent Caretaker Yun flying with a single kick. </p>
			<p> “Scram. If I see you here again, I’ll kill you.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to the members of the Zhang Family. </p>
			<p> “Yes… We won’t dare to do it again!” Caretaker Yun stammered before running out of the courtyard like his *ss was on fire. The members of the Zhang Family followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> The little girl and her father stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape. </p>
			<p> “This old man thanks the Lord!” The little girl’s father fell to his knees and kowtowed several times. </p>
			<p> “Han’er, thank the Lord!” He grabbed the little girl and yelled. </p>
			<p> When she was about to kneel, Huang Xiaolong stopped them and helped him up. “It’s nothing worth mentioning.” </p>
			<p> “Lord, you should leave right now! The Zhang Family is too strong and you shouldn’t be dragged into this!” The old man said. </p>
			<p> Dismissing him, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “It’s just a Primal Ancestor. There’s nothing to worry about. Your meridians were shattered completely… I’ll help you reconnect them.” </p>
			<p> With his body shuddering, the old man stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. “Lord, how did you know?!” His meridians were indeed shattered in the past, but that was a long time ago. That was the reason behind his decline in strength and he was nothing but a cripple. </p>
			<p> Before the incident, he was at the peak of the late-Ninth Order True Saint Realm! A mere Caretaker Yun wouldn’t be able to touch him even if he tried. </p>
			<p> “You can’t hide anything from me.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head, the old man sighed, “My meridians were completely shattered. Not even grand dao herbs can be used to reconnect them. It’s impossible…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and pressed his palm on the old man’s chest. A ray of golden light coursed through the man’s body, healing every single wound and damage he suffered. </p>
			<p> In a few breaths of time, the man was completely recovered! His meridians that were shattered beyond belief were as good as new! </p>
			<p> That wasn’t all. His reconstructed meridians were even stronger than before! Energy surged through his body. </p>
			<p> “This… This…” The old man couldn’t control his tears as he fell to his knees once again. </p>
			<p> “Many thanks to the Lord!” Kowtowing profusely, he cried, “Tao Hang is willing to do anything for the Lord! In the future, I will listen to everything you say!” </p>
			<p> In the past thousands of years, he had been living a life worse than death. He hid in the Falling Water City, prepared to die there. Huang Xiaolong’s appearance gave him a new lease on life. </p>
			<p> A bitter smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face after hearing Tao Hang’s declaration. Ordinary experts at the God of Creation Realm weren’t even qualified to be his subordinate, much less a cultivator at the True Saint Realm… </p>
			<p> “Tao Han’er thanks the lord!” The little girl thanked Huang Xiaolong when she saw her father kowtowing yet again. </p>
			<p> “Alright, get up.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Only then did the two of them get to their feet. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the surrounding courtyard and sighed, “Why don’t you get a better courtyard?” </p>
			<p> “We’ll listen to the lord…” With a look of embarrassment on his face, Tao Hang continued, “I… I don’t have enough spiritual stones or holy bills…” </p>
			<p> “I do.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and waved his hand. </p>
			<p> Even though he didn’t have holy spiritual stones or holy bills used in the Unknown Lands, he had grand dao coins and grand dao spiritual stones! </p>
			<p> With his current identity, there was no way he could lack money!  </p>
			<p> The currency in the Unknown Lands might be different from the thirteen universes, but Huang Xiaolong captured Zhu Qiming and the expert serving him! The amount of treasures they had in their possession were worth trillions upon trillions upon dao coins! </p>
			<p> The three of them left the courtyard and walked towards the Falling Water City’s market. </p>
			<p> Even though Tao Hang had his meridians broken, he had lived in the city for thousands of years. He knew where everything was. It didn’t take long before they entered the largest Chamber of Commerce in the city, the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce. </p>
			<p> “The Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce is the largest trading company in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. It’s owned by the royal family themselves.” Tao Hang explained. </p>
			<p> Nodding slightly, he entered the building with the two of them. </p>
			<p> As the largest chamber of commerce in the celestial empire, it boasted the largest presence in the city. The building itself was majestic, and it was the first time Tao Hang had set foot onto its premises. Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly when he noticed Tao Hang shrinking behind himself. Holding on to Tao Han’er’s hand, he smiled, “There’s no need to be afraid.” </p>

			<p> Tao Han’er nodded obediently, “I won’t be afraid as long as you’re here.” </p>
			<p> Perhaps it was due to Tao Hang and Tao Han’er’s appearance, no one greeted them after they entered the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong walked directly to a counter and brought out a bunch of dao coins. Tossing them out, he muttered, “I’m here to do some shopping.”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3577 – Sword Dao Gate&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> As a branch outlet of the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce in a small city like the Falling Water City, the attendant of the shop wasn’t even at the True Saint Realm! He jumped in fright when he saw the bunch of dao coins Huang Xiaolong tossed onto the counter. </p>
			<p> There were many important people in the main hall doing their business, but they were also shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s actions. </p>
			<p> Dao coins were created by experts in the God of Creation Realm and every one of them contained the grand dao laws. Huang Xiaolong casually tossed out more than three hundred dao coins, and the grand dao qi that filled the air scared everyone present. </p>
			<p> “Lord… What… What do you wish to buy?” The attendant stammered. </p>
			<p> “I’m looking for a courtyard in the Falling Water City. The larger the better.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Lord, please give me a moment to report this to the branch director!” The attendant responded before scuttering away. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Chen Dean, the branch director of the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce to appear before Huang Xiaolong. Even though he was a branch director of the largest chamber of commerce in the celestial empire, he was merely a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. </p>
			<p> In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, he was weaker than an ant. However, he was the strongest expert in the city! </p>
			<p> When Chen Dean arrived before Huang Xiaolong, he became extremely respectful. He introduced every single residence in the city to Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Without thinking too much about the details, Huang Xiaolong tossed out a little more than ten thousand dao coins to purchase the most expensive residence in the city. </p>
			<p> It didn’t cost much to buy a place of residence in a place like the Falling Water City. After all, it wasn’t a major city. Neither was it extremely important to the celestial empire. Of course, everything was relative to Huang Xiaolong’s wealth. If he were to count it in terms of holy bills, the manor would cost more than a hundred million holy bills! </p>
			<p> Settling the paperwork for Huang Xiaolong, Chen Dean wanted to personally escort Huang Xiaolong over to the courtyard. It was too bad he was rejected by Huang Xiaolong. All he had to do was to pass the control tablet of the manor to Tao Hang. </p>
			<p> Chen Dean didn’t dare to say much and he quickly fulfilled Huang Xiaolong’s request. He bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong before leaving, “If you require any assistance, feel free to call on me any time.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly before leaving the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce with Tao Hang and Tao Han’er. </p>
			<p> Not too long after they left the Golden Sea Chamber of Commerce, they were surrounded by a group of experts hailing from the Zhang Family. </p>
			<p> “Second young master, that’s him!” Caretaker Yun hid behind a young man and he pointed towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The young man was the second young master of the Zhang Family, Zhang Shaohuang. He was one of the strongest experts among the later generation of those born in the city. As an expert at the high-level True Saint Realm, he wasn’t afraid of anyone. </p>
			<p> Zhang Shaohuang walked towards Huang Xiaolong, but his gaze was fixed on Tao Hang. “Old Man Tao, how dare you look for someone to beat up my subordinate?” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang stood silently behind Huang Xiaolong as he ignored the kid. </p>
			<p> “Oh? Looks like you found someone really impressive. Humph!” Turning to Huang Xiaolong, he snorted, “Did you come from outside the city? Which family are you from? Let me remind you, my brother-in-law is the direct disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch!” </p>
			<p> There were countless factions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, and the Sword Dao Gate was a creed level entity. Even though they weren’t at the peak of the power pyramid, they were definitely a strong faction. In the region, the Sword Dao Gate was an invincible existence! </p>
			<p> “Sword Dao Gate? Never heard of them.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “All of you should get out of my sight right now. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind killing you all.” </p>
			<p> Zhang Shaohuang stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence, and he narrowed his eyes. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so calm after hearing about their relationship with the Sword Dao Gate. A trace of suspicion formed in his heart. </p>
			<p> “Humph. What audacity.” A voice rang through the air. Zhang Shaohuang turned to the source of the voice and a look of joy formed on his face. </p>
			<p> “Brother-in-law! Why did you come?” </p>
			<p> From afar, dozens of experts strode towards Huang Xiaolong’s group. The person who came was Xu Qi, the direct disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch. The others were core disciples of the Sword Dao Gate. </p>
			<p> Even though Xu Qi was the youngest disciple of the Sword Dao Gate’s patriarch, his talent was something that far surpassed Zhang Shaohuang. He was a Primal Ancestor at the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. His combat strength was comparable to peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors. In the Falling Water City, he was a supreme existence. </p>
			<p> Noticing Zhang Shaohuang’s greeting Xu Qi nodded, “I came out of the sect to carry out a mission with my junior disciples. I came over as it was along the way. Who would have thought that I would meet a show off like that the moment I arrived.” </p>
			<p> A chilly light flashed in his eyes as he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> According to what he knew, the Falling Water City was a city on the outskirts of the celestial empire. No one there was worthy of his attention! </p>
			<p> The experts of the Sword Dao Gate slowly closed in on Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> As Zhang Shaohuang followed closely behind Xu Qi, he continued to stir sh*t. “Brother-in-law, you might not know, but this b*stard has been running his mouth off since a long time ago.” 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> “Since you haven’t heard of my Sword Dao Gate, I’ll let you experience our strength!” Xu Qi looked at one of the core disciples beside him and winked. </p>
			<p> The disciple might not be at the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, but he was a high-level Primal Ancestor regardless. He walked towards Huang Xiaolong and a snort left his lips. The sword in his hand slashed upwards, and a myriad of sword lights surrounded the city. Every single expert in the city could feel the terrifying sword qi gathered in the air.  </p>
			<p> It was too bad the sword light failed to reach Huang Xiaolong. When they arrived a meter away from him, they spun around and shot back towards the core disciple. </p>
			<p> When the sword lights disappeared, the body of the core disciple turned completely stiff. Blood started to leak out from his body as it stained the ground red. </p>
			<p> “Junior Brother Chen!” Xu Qi and the others gasped. </p>
			<p> Zhang Shaohuang, who was a mere True Saint Realm expert, stared at the corpse with his jaws agape. The experts of the Zhang Family were equally stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden revelation of strength. </p>

			<p> “Who are you?! Which sect are you from?!” Xu Qi suppressed the shock in his heart and asked. </p>
			<p> “Sect? I’m acting alone.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Factionless? </p>
			<p> That would make him a wandering expert! </p>
			<p> Xu Qi heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He was afraid that Huang Xiaolong came from an even stronger faction than the Sword Dao Gate. If that was true, he would have provoked an extremely terrifying existence. If only he knew that Huang Xiaolong alone was scarier than all the factions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire put together…</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3578 – Limitless Continent&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “My Sword Dao Gate will remember this!” Xu Qi growled before turning around to leave. </p>
			<p> “Did I tell you to leave?” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> Xu Qi and the others turned around, flabbergasted. </p>
			<p> “Haha, what do you think you’re doing? Do you really think you’re capable enough to capture all of us? Are you planning to kill us all?” </p>
			<p> He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be crazy enough to touch the disciples of the Sword Dao Gate, much less the direct disciple of the patriarch! </p>
			<p> The moment the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong stomped once on the ground below him. The city trembled violently, and the skies seemed to crumble before their very eyes. In an instant, Xu Qi and the experts of the Sword Dao Gate exploded into a mist of blood. </p>
			<p> The disciples of the Zhang Family met the same fate. The only exception was Zhang Shaohuang, and Huang Xiaolong left him alive on purpose. Even though he managed to keep his life, his meridians were completely shattered and his Saint Fate was destroyed. As he crashed into one of the walls surrounding them, he stared at Huang Xiaolong in fear. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Tao Hang and Tao Han’er who were staring at the nasty scene before them. Hugging Tao Han’er, he laughed, “Han’er, are you afraid?” </p>
			<p> Find the original at FreeWebNovel.com.  </p>
			<p> “No I’m not!” Tao Han’er shook her head resolutely. “They are really bad people!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong left the scene, the Falling Water City was thrown into complete chaos. If the sword qi summoned by the core disciple shocked the experts in the city, Huang Xiaolong’s stomp was a hundred times more terrifying! They fell to their knees in fright. </p>
			<p> The old ancestor of the Zhang Family was in his secret chamber, cultivating, when he plopped to his knees in fear. Gasping for breath, he panicked, “I wonder which expert at the Dao Venerable Realm paid a visit to our city…” </p>
			<p> After everything calmed down, he rushed out of his secret chamber to order the patriarch of the Zhang Family to investigate everything that happened. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before the patriarch dragged Zhang Shaohuang back. </p>
			<p> “You.. What?! What did you say?! Xu Qi was killed by someone? Dozens of core disciples of the Sword Dao Gate were killed along with him?!” The old ancestor of the Zhang Family felt the world spinning around him. </p>
			<p> The patriarch of the Zhang Family was similarly terrified. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong returned to the newly bought manor, Tao Hang used the tablet to control the formation protecting the residence. </p>
			<p> Walking around the entire manor, they discovered that it was hundreds of acres large. There were lots of natural structures, and it was something extravagant in the eyes of ordinary Primal Ancestors. However, the residence was comparable to trash in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p> Ignoring the small details, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was only going to stay there for a period of time. Nothing else was as important as locating the Universe Boat. Deciding to settle down for a period of time, Huang Xiaolong continued to search for the strongest universe treasure in the thirteen universes! </p>
			<p> As there were many rooms in the manor, Huang Xiaolong allowed Tao Hang and Tao Han’er to choose one for themselves. When everyone had settled in, he summoned Tao Hang to the main hall to inquire about the matters regarding the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang might be a True Saint, but he traveled to a lot of places in his life. He was extremely knowledgeable about various regions in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong discovered that unlike the various universes, the Unknown Lands was made up of various continents. Not a single great world was contained within, and they were currently situated in a region called the Limitless Continent. Tao Hang had no idea how many celestial empires there were on the Limitless Continent, but he knew that the old ancestor of the Golden Sea Continent was called Jin Hai, and he was a God of Creation at the large completion stage. </p>
			<p> The Golden Sea Celestial Empire managed countless cities, and the Falling Water City was one of them. </p>
			<p> Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong gained a better understanding about the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang might not know much, but Huang Xiaolong managed to extrapolate the information he obtained. It seemed as though the large continents were created by the supreme experts who managed to transcend the destruction of the thirteen universes. </p>
			<p> Every single continent was the territory of one of the overlords! </p>
			<p> As for the celestial empires, they were all under the control of a single entity! </p>
			<p> “Are there any forbidden areas around the Golden Sea Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang had no idea what Huang Xiaolong’s intention was, but he replied all the same. “Yes. Tehre is a place called the Sentient Mountain Range located in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. It’s a place where ferocious beasts thrive. It’s the most dangerous region in the celestial empire, and the mountain range stretches across ninety percent of the region!” </p>
			<p> “It has been a place where the various factions would send their disciples to undergo life or death training. I heard that the crown prince of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire would frequently go there to train! The princess would do the same!” </p>
			<p> “However, they would only dare to remain on the outskirts of the mountain range. Ferocious beasts comparable to Dao Venerables who comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level stay in the depths of the Sentient Mountain Range!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and he asked about the location of the mountain range. Getting Tao Hang to stand back, Huang Xiaolong tore through space. </p>
			<p> Several minutes later, he returned with five beasts beside him. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang stared at Huang Xiaolong as a strange look formed on his face. Could the five beasts he brought back be… There was no way… They had to be ordinary beasts Huang Xiaolong caught on a whim. </p>
			<p> His guess was on point. Huang Xiaolong took a trip over to the Sentient Mountain Range and captured all five beasts kings. Their strength was comparable to Gu Yuan and Long Yi back in the First Universe before they ascended to the God of Creation Realm.  </p>
			<p> As Zhu Qiming and the others had some sort of restriction in their bodies, Huang Xiaolong was unable to control them as he wished. He could only choose the next best option. With the five beast kings, he wouldn’t have to dirty his hands every time he wanted to do something. </p>
			<p> It was too bad he failed to find any beasts at the God of Creation level. </p>
			<p> From their memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Sentient Mountain Range had two beasts comparable to Gods of Creation. However, they went to the Land of Death and were nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> In the following month, Huang Xiaolong went out with three beast kings, Tao Hang, and Tao Han’er everyday to scour the markets. The two other beast kings were left behind to guard the manor. </p>
			<p> Even after a month, there was no clue on the location of the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> As night fell… 𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the stars twinkling in the skies and he sighed. The stars seemed to be a little brighter than those in the thirteen universes. Even so, his mind was stuck on the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> He looked through every corner of the city, only to be disappointed time and time again. Could the Universe Boat be located outside the city? Perhaps, it was located in the surrounding regions. </p>
			<p> Retrieving the Universe Sphere, Huang Xiaolong looked at the faint glow surrounding it. Despite his actions, he failed to receive any reaction from it. </p>
			<p> A moment later, he retrieved the Universe Sphere and muttered, “I wonder if there are any antique shops or marketplaces in the city…”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3579 – Tao Family&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When Tao Hang heard Huang Xiaolong’s question, he thought for a second and replied, “There seems to be an antique market in the northern part of town… It’s just a small street, and no one really goes there.” </p>
			<p> “There should be several stalls that sell antiques there.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded and muttered, “Alright, we’ll head over there to take a look.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> Even though he had no idea what Huang Xiaolong was doing, he could tell that Huang Xiaolong was looking for something specific after a month of shopping around. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong left the residence with Tao Hang and the others. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Tao Han’er smiled and bragged to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, I learned the first move of the sword art you taught me!” </p>
			<p> “Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock. </p>
			<p> The Myriad Dao Sword Art that he passed down to them was created by a God of Creation in the thirteen universes. Huang Xiaolong noticed that Tao Han’er had an affinity for sword arts, and he decided to teach her a little. Who would have thought that she would gain a preliminary understanding in a short month? Her talent was pretty amazing if Huang Xiaolong said so himself.  </p>
			<p> “Yeah! When we get back, I’ll show you!” Tao Han’er grinned. </p>
			<p> “Sure.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “If you really managed to learn it, I’ll reward you with some delicious food.” </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Tao Han’er’s eyes. “Are we going to eat Fire Bugs?” </p>
			<p> “Of course.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. In the Star Dragon Universe, Starly was extremely fond of eating Fire Bugs and Huang Xiaolong reared some in the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> “Lord, you dote on Han’er too much…” A thankful expression was revealed on Tao Hang’s face. “We can never repay the Lord's grace…” </p>
			<p> “It’s alright. This is the fate we share between us. Han’er is extremely talented in the sword arts, and she will definitely shock the Golden Sea Celestial Empire in the future.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> After all, Huang Xiaolong was teaching her personally! With a God of Creation with 17.4 billion units of grand cosmos energy as her teacher, it would be difficult to be mediocre. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely once again. </p>
			<p> In the month that passed, Huang Xiaolong not only restored his meridians, he also passed down a set of martial arts to him. He provided an endless supply of grand dao spiritual herbs, and now, Tao Hang had already broken through to the First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. He solidified his foundations at the cultivation realm, and he felt as though he was living in a dream. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong continued, “Both you and Han’er are pretty talented. With my teaching, you will definitely be able to enter the Dao Venerable Realm in the future.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang felt his heart trembling slightly. </p>
			<p> Entering the Dao Venerable Realm? </p>
			<p> That was something he didn’t dare to dream of! </p>
			<p> A Dao Venerable could create their own faction in the celestial empire, and that itself was an extraordinary feat! 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝙗𝒏𝒐𝒗𝙚𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t reveal to them the fact that they were learning creation-level techniques. They were destined to cross the Dao Venerable Realm to become a God of Creation in the future. </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you for real? Are we really going to become Dao Venerables in the future?” Tao Han’er’s eyes sparkled. Even though she was young, she was extremely sharp. She had extremely good looks, and she was destined to grow up to be a country-toppling beauty. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement when he saw the expectant look on her face. “Of course I’m telling the truth.” </p>
			<p> “Father, when we enter the Dao Venerable Realm in the future, we can take revenge for mother!” Tao Han’er smiled. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang had a look of happiness on his face too. However, there was a slight desperation that flashed through his eyes. </p>
			<p> “Revenge?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Hesitating slightly, Tao Hang explained, “Before entering the Falling Water City, I was an inner disciple of the Tao Family in the Golden Sea City. I offended a core disciple of the family, and he shattered my meridians. In order to save me, my wife stopped them by sacrificing her life. I managed to escape, and I’ve been hiding in the Falling Water City ever since.” </p>
			<p> “Several years ago, I met Tao Han’er by accident. Her parents were nowhere to be seen, and she agreed to be my foster daughter. Tao Han’er might not be my flesh and blood, but she’s accustomed to calling me her father.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. Even without Tao Hang’s explanation, he could tell that they weren’t blood related. He was only slightly surprised to learn how Tao Hang’s injury came about. </p>
			<p> Regardless, he had seen too many incidents where disciples attacked and killed members of the same family. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang continued, “The core disciple of the Tao Family is called Tao Xinren. Even though he was only a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, he’s the grandson of an eminent elder in the family. The eminent elder managed to comprehend four elements to the perfection level! Even if I manage to enter the Dao Venerable Realm, it’s hopeless…” </p>
			<p> A look of despair formed on Tao Hang’s face. </p>
			<p> “Father, we might not be able to do it ourselves, but we can ask the lord to help us!” Tao Han’er quipped. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head slowly, Tao Hang sighed. Huang Xiaolong’s strength might shock him, but the opponent they were facing was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended the elements! According to Tao Hang, there was no way Huang Xiaolong would offend an expert of the Tao Family for that small matter!  </p>
			<p> The Tao Family was one of the strongest families in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire! The old ancestor of the Tao Family was an expert who comprehended all thirteen elements to the perfection level! From his estimations, Huang Xiaolong was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended five elements to perfection level. Even if he could get rid of Tao Xinren’s grandfather, he wouldn’t be able to deal with the old ancestor of the Tao Family! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained impassive when he looked at Tao Hang. He chose not to reveal his true strength at that very moment. After locating the Universe Boat, it wouldn’t be too late to head over to the Tao Family to help Tao Hang set things straight. </p>
			<p> A moment later, the three of them arrived at the street Tao Hang described. </p>
			<p> Indeed, it wasn’t too busy. There were thirty stalls at best, and all of them looked worn down by the sands of time. Some of them had a thick layer of dust in front of their stalls, and no one could tell their stall name. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong entered the first stall without much fanfare. </p>
			<p> From the outside, the stall was comparable to a rickety cart. However, the space contained inside was anything else but! It was massive, and there were countless artifacts strewn all about. </p>
			<p> Seeing that he had customers, the owner of the stall was ecstatic. He ran up to Huang Xiaolong and introduced most of the products he had. He described them down to the last detail, including which Dao Venerable’s wife it belonged to! </p>
			<p> Seeing that the Universe Boat wasn’t in the stall, Huang Xiaolong grabbed several random toys for Tao Han’er before leaving. </p>
			<p> Entering the stalls one by one, Huang Xiaolong looked around casually. His dao souls were doing the actual work of locating the Universe Boat, but to no avail. </p>
			<p> When he finally entered the ninth stall, Huang Xiaolong paused for a second and he looked at a jade hairpin before him. The hairpin might not be the Universe Boat, but it was definitely created by a God of Creation!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3580 – We Don’t Want It Anymore&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, the stalls were pretty much broken shacks no matter how large the space was within. Even so, they actually had something so precious! The hairpin might not be a creation artifact, but it was a top-grade dao artifact! To experts who were trying to comprehend the elements, it was a priceless treasure! </p>
			<p> “How much for the jade hairpin?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> With his many years of experience, the owner of the stall could see that Huang Xiaolong was extremely interested in the jade hairpin. Seeing that there was a chance to sell a mere ornament to some rich upstart, a light twinkled in his eyes. “The hairpin was obtained by my ancestor in an immortal cave. The hairpin is made up of golden spiritual jade, and it’s extremely rare! It’s really well made too!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed and interrupted the owner before he could continue. “Tell me the price of the hairpin.” </p>
			<p> “One million holy bills!” The owner of the stall stretched out a single finger and observed Huang Xiaolong’s reaction. </p>
			<p> “What?! A million?! How can a mere hairpin cost a million holy bills?!” Tao Hang roared in fright. </p>
			<p> “This isn’t any ordinary jade hairpin… My ancestor said that this is probably crafted by a Dao Venerable, and you’ll be buying it for a bargain for a million holy bills! If you really want it, I’ll give you a ten percent discount!” </p>
			<p> Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong tossed out a hundred dao coins to the owner of the shop. “I’ll take it at full price.” </p>
			<p> Since one holy coin was equivalent to ten thousand holy bills, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care much about it.  </p>
			<p> The owner of the stall jumped with joy when he received the payment. </p>
			<p> With the hairpin in hand, Huang Xiaolong was about to give it to Tao Han’er when a voice rang through the air. “The jade hairpin isn’t crafted by a Dao Venerable. It’s created by a Dao Venerable who has already comprehended several elements. It’s worth much more than that.” </p>
			<p> The owner of the shop was stunned, and he looked at a young girl who just entered his shop. She was followed by an older lady, and the older lady seemed to be her bodyguard. </p>
			<p> “Refined by a Dao Venerable who mastered several elements?!” The owner of the stall gasped. </p>
			<p> If that was really true, it would be worth a hundred times the price! </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” The young lady said. “It’s not made from Golden Spiritual Jade either. It’;s made from a grand dao treasure called Golden Silk Jade. The material alone is worth more than ten thousand dao coins.” </p>
			<p> Golden Silk Jade! 𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> The owner of the stall was dumbstruck. </p>
			<p> “Looks like you were scammed by that young man.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh. “Little lass, I came here to buy stuff. I paid whatever the owner wanted! Why would I be scamming him? He told me it was Golden Spiritual Jade himself. Please tell me how I scammed him.” </p>
			<p> With a frown on her face, the young lady snapped, “Do you really think you would purchase it with a million holy bills if he didn’t say what? You can clearly tell how special the material is but you chose not to tell the owner. You’re obviously trying to trick him!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed. It seemed as though she wasn’t a person who listened to reason. </p>
			<p> Before Tao Hang could speak up for Huang Xiaolong, she continued, “I’ll give you twenty thousand dao coins. Sell it to me.” </p>
			<p> The owner of the stall felt his throat going dry. </p>
			<p> Twenty thousand dao coins! </p>
			<p> The price was much higher than what Huang Xiaolong paid! Anyone would be tempted by so much money! However, since he had already accepted Huang Xiaolong’s payment earlier, the item belonged to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> From how Huang Xiaolong tossed out the money a moment ago, he knew that Huang Xiaolong was not someone he could offend too.  </p>
			<p> “Thirty thousand! I’ll pay you thirty thousand dao coins!” The young lady continued. </p>
			<p> Thirty thousand! </p>
			<p> Looking at Huang Xiaolong, a thought flashed in his head. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Little lass, this hairpin already belongs to me. Shouldn’t you be negotiating with me instead?” </p>
			<p> Staring at Huang Xiaolong in silence, she glanced at the owner again before sneering, “I’ll buy it from you for forty thousand dao coins! You spent a hundred dao coins on it previously. You’ll earn a lot by selling it to me.” </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> An amused chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Did anyone tell you I’m poor? I don’t need your money.” </p>
			<p> The young lady’s expression sank and she growled, “How much for the hairpin?” </p>
			<p> “I won’t sell it no matter how much you offer.” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually. </p>
			<p> The older lady behind her locked on to Huang Xiaolong with her aura all of a sudden, and Huang Xiaolong looked at them like he was looking at clowns. “Are you planning to rob me now that your negotiations failed?” </p>
			<p> He could tell that the young lady and the older lady were both Dao Venerables who had comprehended the elements. The older lady was an expert who had comprehended eight elements to grand perfection level, and she was evidently not someone from the Falling Water City. </p>
			<p> Without Huang Xiaolong’s instructions, the three beasts waiting outside slowly got to their feet and glared at the two ladies. </p>
			<p> When the older lady felt the subtle suppression coming from the three beasts, her expression changed drastically. “Young Lady, we have to leave!” </p>
			<p> Afraid that the young lady would make a foolish move and offend the hidden expert before her, she turned to Huang Xiaolong and yelled, “We don’t want the hairpin anymore!” </p>
			<p> Pulling the young lady’s arm, they left the stall in a hurry. </p>
			<p> It didn't take long for the two of them to disappear down the street. </p>
			<p> As the situation changed too quickly, the owner of the stall was too shocked to say anything.  </p>
			<p> Turning around, Huang Xiaolong tossed a bunch of grand dao spiritual stones to the stall owner. “You can have these grand dao spiritual stones as compensation.” </p>
			<p> Receiving the spiritual stones, the owner stuttered, “Lord… I…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to drag things on and he placed the hairpin on Tao Han’er’s head. Telling her to keep it well, he decided to assist her in refining it after they returned. He continued to look at the other items in the stall. </p>
			<p> The owner bowed after keeping the stones. </p>
			<p> Right before Huang Xiaolong could leave the stall, he noticed a tiny object from the corner of his eye. It was a tiny boat that was hidden in an inconspicuous corner! It was the size of his palm, and it seemed to be an item weathered by the storms of time. Dirt and mud stained its surface, and the owner of the stall didn’t even bother cleaning it up. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat. </p>
			<p> Could it be?! </p>
			<p> Even at his level, Huang Xiaolong felt his heartbeat accelerating. </p>
			<p> Even though he didn’t know if he was looking at the greatest treasure in the thirteen universes, he could tell that the tiny boat was something extraordinary. That was because he couldn’t tell what material it was made from! That point alone was enough to prove how special it was! </p>
			<p> Grabbing the tiny boat in his hand, Huang Xiaolong felt the Universe Sphere thumping once in response.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3581 – Pretty Ferocious&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Initially, Huang Xiaolong was unable to confirm the legitimacy of the Universe Boat. However, the Universe Sphere in his hands trembled slightly, and joy quickly filled his heart. If the little boat could resonate with the Universe Sphere, it was more than likely for it to be the Universe Boat! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart jumped in joy. </p>
			<p> Universe Boat! </p>
			<p> The universe-grade treasure born from the First Universe! </p>
			<p> It was the fastest treasure in all thirteen universes, and it possessed the strongest offensive abilities! </p>
			<p> Moreover, there was a rumor that one could comprehend the mysteries of the universe when they cultivated in the formation of the Universe Boat! It would greatly assist them in breaking through to the Universe God Realm! </p>
			<p> The boss was slightly stunned when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s expression. The little boat was something he managed to pick up god knew how long ago. It seemed as though he found it when he was searching for precious herbs in the mountain ranges. He picked it up as it looked pretty cool, but he couldn’t understand how special it was. As such, he tossed it in the corner. </p>
			<p> “How much for the boat?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Hesitating for a moment, the boss was no amatuer. From the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the boss knew that the boat was something special. Even so, he had no idea what it exactly was, and he could only try his luck.  </p>
			<p> “Lord… How about a hundred… A hundred thousand dao coins?!” After all, no successful businessman would give up a chance to make more money. The man looked at Huang Xiaolong cautiously after offering the price. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s laughter shook the heavens when he saw the hesitant look on the boss’ face. </p>
			<p> When the boss thought that things were about to go south, Huang Xiaolong tossed over a spatial ring. </p>
			<p> Opening the ring, the boss saw dao coins piled up to the heavens. There were countless dao coins in the ring, and they were more than enough to form several mountain ranges. With his hands trembling in shock, he nearly dropped the ring. </p>
			<p> How many dao coins were in there?! </p>
			<p> A billion?! </p>
			<p> Tens of billions?! </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord… This… Are these really for me?!” </p>

			<p> “What’s wrong? Is it too little?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “No, no, no, in fact, it’s too much!” The boss stuttered. </p>
			<p> With the amount of dao coins in the ring, he would be more than set for life. </p>
			<p> “I hope that no one learns about what happened today.” Huang Xiaolong reminded. </p>
			<p> “Lord, you can rest assured that no one will learn of the events that happened here today.” The boss spoke hastily and he quickly swore an oath. In fact, he wouldn’t go around telling people what happened anyway. After all, he would suffer a fate worse than death if people learned that he managed to obtain several billion dao coins! </p>
			<p> Even the families that stood at the peak of the universe would be tempted by the amount of money he had! </p>
			<p> In order to play safe, Huang Xiaolong laid down a restriction in the boss’ body. “If you speak of the little boat, the restriction will tear your soul to shreds.” </p>
			<p> As the blood drained from the boss’ face, Huang Xiaolong continued, “Not to worry. No harm will befall you as long as you keep the secret.” </p>
			<p> The boss nodded hurriedly. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Huang Xiaolong’s group left the store.  </p>
			<p> The moment he left, the pretty lady who brought around the little girl with her hid somewhere in the city. The lady comprehended eight of the thirteen elements, but there was a look of fear in her eyes. </p>
			<p> “Aunt Hong, what’s wrong? Is that young man really that scary?” The young girl frowned and asked, “Didn’t you say that Yu Chai probably had a peak-grade grand dao artifact crafted by a God of Creation?!” </p>
			<p> The lady revealed a bitter smile and continued, “Xiaoyue, even if we wish to snatch their treasure, we need to be strong enough to do it!” </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue continued, “Is the young man as strong as you? However, he looks extremely ordinary. He shouldn’t be an expert, right?” </p>
			<p> The lady shook her head and sighed, “I have no idea how strong the young man is, but the beasts around him are terrifyingly strong.” </p>
			<p> “Terrifyingly strong?” Wei Xiaoyue gasped. “Do you think that they’re experts who comprehended ten elements? There’s no way! This is just a tiny little Falling Water City…” 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝓃𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> “I’m afraid that they’re stronger than that…” </p>
			<p> “What?! Aunt Hong, do you think that they comprehended eleven elements?!” </p>
			<p> The lady shook her head again. Her expression turned extremely serious and she muttered, “They might be experts who have comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level!” </p>
			<p> “How is that possible?!” Wei Xiaoyue yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> The Wei Family she came from was one of the strongest powers in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. Several billion years ago, their Wei Family produced a God of Creation Realm expert. As such, their influence in the world was only lower than the royal family of the celestial empire! Even so, the number of experts who had comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level could be counted on both hands. </p>
			<p> Experts who comprehended the thirteen elements to the grand perfection level were only weaker than God of Creation Realm experts, and they weren’t common even in the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> How could three of them appear in a tiny city like that? </p>
			<p> “Aunt Hong, do you think you might have made a mistake?” </p>
			<p> Hesitating slightly, the lady continued, “Perhaps… They might have comprehended twelve elements, but even so, it speaks volumes of the youngster’s identity.” </p>
			<p> For someone to be protected by three beasts at that level was something unheard of! Not even the young master of the Wei Family would be given such treatment. </p>
			<p> “Do you mean that the youngster might be a Son of Creation? He might also be the son of a God of Creation! However, that doesn’t seem possible. He looks too ordinary!” </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue continued, “A Son of Creation paying a visit to a tiny city like this doesn’t make sense!” </p>
			<p> The lady started to think of the reasons and a frown foremed on her face. “Could he also be here because of Yu Chai?! I’m afraid that that’s the only possible explanation. He might have obtained some news on the treasure before coming over to pay Yu Chai a visit!”  </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, a peak-grade grand dao treasure crafted by a God of Creation was definitely worth looking into. It wouldn’t be weird if a Son of Creation personally showed up. </p>
			<p> “Do you think we should give up on Yu Chai?” Wei Xiaoyue was a little reluctant to leave like that. After all, that was a peak-grade grand dao artifact they were talking about! </p>
			<p> “If that young man really is a Son of Creation, not even your father would choose to offend him over a mere treasure!” </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue’s father was the patriarch of the Wei Family, and his influence in the region was huge. </p>
			<p> Even so, he wouldn’t be stupid enough to offend someone like that! </p>
			<p> “Should we notify the patriarch of the Sword Dao Gate?” Wei Xiaoyue continued. </p>
			<p> Running into Huang Xiaolong’s group was no coincidence. Originally, Wei Xiaoyue’s plan was to travel around the places of interest in the Falling Water City. She heard that someone killed the direct disicple of the Sword Dao Patriarch, and she decided to look for the murderer in the city. </p>
			<p> The Sword Dao Gate was closely related to the Wei Family, and the patriarch was the uncle of someone in the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> Due to their relationship, the patriarch of the Sword Dao Gate would frequently bring gifts over for the doyens of the family in order to show his loyalty. As such, the Sword Dao Gate could be considered a power under the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> A frosty look appeared on Aunt Hong’s face. “If the Sword Dao Patriarch is stupid enough to offend that youngster, they deserve everything coming to them!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3582 – Pulling Your Ears&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The eminent elder related to the Sword Dao Patriarch was at odds with Aunt Hong, and they wouldn’t stop till one of them was dead. As such, the Sword Dao Gate’s survival wasn’t her concern. </p>
			<p> In fact, she might celebrate quietly when the Sword Dao Gate was eliminated! </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue knew about the problems within the family, and she hesitated for a moment before asking, “Will it affect our Wei Family?” </p>
			<p> “Of course not. Relax, the Sword Dao Gate is a lackey of our family. We can cast it aside whenever we want. If he chooses to destroy the Sword Dao Gate, he wouldn’t dare to offend our family. After all, we’re no pushovers.” </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue nodded slowly. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After leaving the shop, Huang Xiaolong was in a great mood. It was the first time he felt at ease in a long time. After all, the Universe Boat was finally in his hands! </p>
			<p> With the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be afraid of Mei Jie even if the man reached the peak of the God of Creation Realm. So what if the man had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy?! Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could beat the man to death. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt his body loosening up as the worries slowly left his mind. His dao souls started to experience a subtle transformation.  </p>
			<p> He was in no rush to refine the treasure even after he got his hands on it. Instead, he started to stroll down the streets with no worry. He bought everything that caught his eye, and for once, he splurged with no restraint! </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong, Tao Hang, and Tao Han’er rode on their beasts back to the manor, a huge group of experts from the Sword Dao Gate arrived in the city! Other than the members of the Sword Dao Gate, there were many members of the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> The Sword Dao Gate didn’t make any moves the moment Liu Qi was killed because they were waiting for the members of the Wei Family! </p>
			<p> Every single expert who arrived were Dao Venerables, and they were much stronger than Liu Qi! </p>
			<p> The disciples of the Wei Family stood at the very front, and they puffed their chests out as they strolled down the street. More than a hundred Dao Venerables of the Sword Dao Gate followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> “That brat is pretty strong. We might have to trouble several lords…” An eminent elder of the Sword Dao Gate, Zhu Quan, spoke to the members of the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> Even though the patriarch of the Sword Dao Gate didn’t personally come, he sent several eminent elders out. Zhu Quan was ranked slightly above average among those who came, and he was a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. </p>
			<p> Wei Dafa, a disciple of the Wei Family, roared with laughter, “It’s nothing! After all, I’ll be in the area anyway. We’ll complete our task after dealing with that little punk. It won’t take up too much time…” </p>
			<p> The disciples of the Wei Family were all inner disciples, and they were pretty famous even in the family. All of them comprehended the elements, and they were sent out by the eminent elder related to the Sword Dao Patriarch. </p>
			<p> Zhu Quan chuckled, “Lords, you are geniuses among geniuses! You managed to comprehend the elements when you’re so young, and you will definitely become a core disciple of the family!” </p>
			<p> Wei Dafa snickered, “The geniuses in the Wei Family are uncountable! We need to work harder if we want to enter the ranks of core disciples.” Despite what he said, everyone could hear the smugness in his voice. </p>
			<p> As the members of the Wei Family and the Sword Dao Gate entered the city, the members of the Zhang Family, and the various large families in the city were waiting respectfully at the side. The city master was also present. </p>
			<p> They got to their knees the moment the members of the Wei Family approached. </p>
			<p> The old ancestors of the great families in the city were rarely seen, now, they were kneeling before a group of experts without so much as a complaint! </p>
			<p> It was a rare sight indeed. </p>
			<p> Even though the city master of the Falling Water City was someone of considerable status, he was a disciple of the Sword Dao Gate. With the power of the Sword Dao Gate and the Wei Family, it was no wonder their disciples could turn into city lords. </p>
			<p> There were countless cities ruled by the ancient races and super families, and the celestial empire was too lazy to be bothered with it. </p>
			<p> “You can rise.” Wei Dafa spoke. </p>
			<p> When they received the order, they got to their feet. </p>
			<p> “Lead the way. Bring me to the youngster’s manor.” Wei Dafa snorted. “Also, get some men to head over there first to wait for us to arrive.” </p>
			<p> “Tell him that the members of the Wei Family are there to question him.” </p>
			<p> He was like a king passing down his decree. </p>
			<p> However, it was true. For inner disciples like Wei Dafa, he was like an emperor in a small city like that. </p>
			<p> The Wei Family was a behemoth in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, and the status of an inner disciple was impressive. </p>
			<p> As soon as Wei Dafa gave the order, the city lord and the old ancestors of the other families didn’t dare to dally. They sent their experts over to Huang Xiaolong’s manor immediately. </p>
			<p> They also told their disciples to pass down Wei Dafa’s order, word for word. </p>
			<p> When that was done, Wei Dafa and the others started to set out for Huang Xiaolong’s manor. </p>
			<p> Not too long after they passed down the order, the faces of the old ancestors present turned ugly. They received a report that every single disciple who went over to Huang Xiaolong’s manor was killed by the beasts who served him. </p>
			<p> “What’s wrong?” Wei Dafa asked when he saw the looks on their faces. </p>
			<p> The city master and the various ancestors stared at each other before telling Wei Dafa everything. 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> When they heard the reports, their expressions sank.  </p>
			<p> “They were killed by the beasts?! Do you know how strong the beasts actually are?” Zhu Quan frowned. </p>
			<p> “We have no idea.” The old ancestor of the Zhang Family shook his head. “Tao Hang strolled around with the beast, but we are unable to determine its strength. It should be in the Dao Venerable Realm.” </p>
			<p> Wei Dafa snorted openly. “It’s not like we haven’t killed beasts who had comprehended the elements…” </p>
			<p> “Lord Wei Dafa is right. With so many lords present, the beasts will be dead no matter how strong they are!” Zhu Quan continued to suck up to them. “Since the brat dares to defy Lord Dafa’s order, he’s asking to die! Let’s see how he begs for mercy later!” </p>
			<p> Another eminent elder smiled, “He better pull his ears while begging for mercy later…” </p>
			<p> Amidst their laughter, they arrived around the manor. </p>
			<p> When they saw the restrictions around it, Wei Dafa roared with laughter, “Primal Ancestor level restrictions?! Hahaha! Is he trying to scare off kids?!” </p>
			<p> Laughter filled the air once again. </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3583 – Killing Members of the Wei Family&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Of course, there were also three beasts who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level standing guard around the manor. There was no point in strengthening the restrictions. </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Watch how I shatter the restrictions around the manor!” Wei Dafa roared. </p>
			<p> Zhu Quan approached him quickly and chuckled, “Lord Wei Dafa, there is no need for you to dirty your hands by shattering a Primal Ancestor level formation. Any one of us can do it for you!” </p>
			<p> “It doesn’t matter. I’ll shatter the restriction while killing the beasts! Let’s see if Huang Xiaolong dares to stay in hiding after that happens.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Quan and the others didn’t dare to go against his will. </p>
			<p> As a sword emerged from Wei Dafa’s back, he pointed at the manor and screamed, “Go!” </p>
			<p> The sword turned into a ray of light that was several thousand miles long as it covered the entire manor. It slashed downwards as a sea of light engulfed the entire city. </p>
			<p> The light contained the power of gold at its peak level.  </p>
			<p> Wei Dafa not only managed to comprehend the power of gold, he reached the minor completion stage in it! </p>
			<p> Under the power he unleashed, sword qi filled the air. The power was shocking, and the experts standing all around felt the world around them shaking. The faces of those from the Sword Dao Gate changed, and there was less to say about the Primal Ancestors under the families in the city. Their legs trembled under the pressure. </p>
			<p> Seeing as the ray of light was about to crush the manor, a bear’s paw reached out from inside the manor to shatter the blade formed with light. Next, the paw came crashing down, causing the entire city to shake. </p>
			<p> When it was done, the paw returned to the manor. </p>
			<p> The change was too sudden, and the experts standing around were unable to react in time. Like the city lord and the old ancestors all around, they stared at the skies in shock. </p>
			<p> “This… This… This..” The disciples of the Wei Family gasped in fright. They failed to close their jaws, and they looked at the giant abyss that formed before them. All that was left of Wei Dafa was a puddle of blood. </p>
			<p> The man who had been ordering everyone about like a god who descended from the heavens was lying dead in a deep abyss! His sword had been crushed into countless pieces, and he couldn’t be more dead! </p>
			<p> An inner disciple of the Wei Family who had comprehended the power of gold to the minor completion stage was killed just like that! </p>
			<p> Silence descended on the lands. </p>
			<p> The disciples of the Wei Family didn’t know what to say, and the members of the Sword Dao Gate remained quiet. </p>
			<p> While the deafening silence filled the lands, several voices slowly transmitted over. An old man, a youngster, and a little girl rode on ferocious beasts as they strolled over. </p>
			<p> “Tao… Tao Hang!” The old ancestor of the Zhang Family stuttered. </p>
			<p> The three of them were precisely Huang Xiaolong and gang who were getting back from their shopping spree. </p>
			<p> The members of the Wei Family who were dragged there to deal with an unknown man called ‘Huang Xiaolong’ widened their eyes when they saw the youngster riding towards them. Wasn’t that guy… </p>
			<p> Their faces started to change as Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived before them. 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝒎 </p>
			<p> “It’s pretty lively here.” Huang Xiaolong looked at them and commented casually. </p>
			<p> He knew what happened the moment the members of the Wei Family and the Sword Dao Gate entered the city. After all, his dao souls weren’t for show. He could cover the entire city if he so wished. </p>
			<p> “Lord, these are the disciples of the Wei Family!” Tao Hang’s expression changed as he addressed Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When they bumped into Wei Xiaoyue and the other lady she called Aunt Hong in the city, Tao Hang didn’t recognize them as they weren’t wearing the robes of the Wei Family. Things were different this time. After all, the disciples standing before them wore the robes of inner disciples of the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> As an inner disciple of the Tao Family, Tao Hang knew how prestigious their status was! In the past, an inner disciple of the Wei Family went to their Tao Family and everyone above the grand elder level was summoned to welcome them! </p>
			<p> The Wei Family members who were stuck in a state of shock snapped back to reality and they heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that someone recognized them. </p>
			<p> “That’s right, we are inner disciples of the Wei Family!” Someone glared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted, “Which family are you from?! How dare you kill an inner disciple of the Wei Family?!” He pointed at Wei Dafa’s corpse and continued, “Senior Brother Dafa isn’t a mere inner disciple of the Wei Family! He’s the second disciple of a grand elder!” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang’s expression changed once again. </p>
			<p> They actually killed a disciple of a grand elder! </p>
			<p> He felt the world crashing down on him. </p>
			<p> “Oh. What about you guys? Are you disciples of grand elders?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> The disciples standing around had no idea what Huang Xiaolong meant, and they stared at him in silence. </p>
			<p> “Since I’ve killed a disciple of a grand elder, it doesn’t matter how many more I kill.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> The faces of those from the Wei Family changed. They were about to rage when the beast Huang Xiaolong was riding on casually swiped its paws. It sent everyone deep into the earth. </p>
			<p> The disciples of the Wei Family were killed just like that.  </p>
			<p> Everyone else who was standing around nearly fainted when they saw what happened. There were even several old ancestors who fell to their knees. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Quan and the others as he sighed, “I didn’t go to the Sword Dao Gate to mess with you, and here you are looking for me.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Quan and the others fell to the ground and he stammered, “Lord, I… We…” </p>
			<p> “What else do you have to say? Speak your last words.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> No one dared to raise their heads. </p>
			<p> As his beast flicked a single finger, everyone who stood against Huang Xiaolong was sent flying into the skies. They flew out of the city, and they turned into puddles of blood when they landed. </p>
			<p> As for the city lord and the rest, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to get rid of them. “Go report to the Wei Family and the Sword Dao Gate that I won’t spare them if they try to mess with me again!” </p>
			<p> Everyone slammed their heads into the ground in acknowledgement. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong entered the manor with the other two. </p>
			<p> Those kneeling outside the manor only dared to raise their heads after a very long time.</p>

			<title>
				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3584 – Refining the Universe Boat&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Following closely behind Huang Xiaolong, Tao Hang said anxiously, “Lord, the Wei Family is the greatest family in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire! They are only second to the royal family, and not even my Tao Family can come close to their power!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong glanced at him casually and spoke, “There’s nothing to worry about. Don’t think about the Wei Family. Even if the royal family of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire arrives, there’s nothing to be afraid of!” </p>
			<p> Under Tao Hang’s weird gaze, Huang Xiaolong entered the main hall. </p>
			<p> “Father…” Tao Han’er softly called out to her father after a long time. </p>
			<p> Snapping back to reality, he quickly followed Tao Han’er into the courtyard. Even so, Huang Xiaolong’s words rang in his mind. He couldn’t understand what he meant. </p>
			<p> After they returned to the manor, Huang Xiaolong quickly told them about his intention to enter seclusion, and for the two of them to continue cultivating by themselves. He also sent the five beasts to guide the two of them. </p>
			<p> As soon as Huang Xiaolong entered his palace, he retrieved the Universe Boat. He looked at the little boat that was stained with dirt, and an indescribable feeling formed in his heart. If not for the Universe Sphere, locating the Universe Boat wouldn’t be as easy as he thought. </p>
			<p> With the power of radiance swirling around his hand, he cleaned the boat thoroughly. The exterior that looked like a dilapidated temple was wiped completely clean. It sparkled with endless radiance, and it was breathtaking. </p>
			<p> The unassuming little boat finally regained its appearance of a treasure. Even so, no one would be able to connect the weird little boat in his hands to the Universe Boat.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sucked in a long breath and calmed himself. Turning into the Star Dragon Divine Tree, he circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and the Pangu World Creation Art. Waves of star dragon energy started to fall from the void as it enveloped the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Under the power of the star dragon energy, the Universe Boat finally started to resonate. Rays of light came from the boat, and it was completely different from the starlight emitted from the divine tree. Instead, the radiance of the Universe Boat seemed to swallow everything, and it seemed as though it transcended the universes. </p>
			<p> Initially, the light from the Universe Boat tried to resist the star dragon energy pouring into it. No matter how hard Huang Xiaolong tried, he was unable to inject any energy into the treasure. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong started the refinement of the Universe Boat, the events that happened in the city caused the region to tremble! The news of the deaths of the disciples of the Sword Dao Gate and Wei Family had already spread across the region! </p>
			<p> Countless cities were trembling in face of the news. </p>
			<p> When Zhou He, the Sword Dao Patriarch, heard of the news, he started to panic. </p>
			<p> “Wei Family?! Wei Dafa and the others were killed?!” Zhou He asked the various eminent elders standing around. </p>
			<p> “Yes… Patriarch, that’s right.” The eminent elder lowered his head and stuttered, “Do you think we should… Do you think we should report this to Lord Wei Bi?” </p>
			<p> The death of several disciples of the Wei Family was nothing special. However, if the Wei Family wanted to use this matter to mess with the Sword Dao Gate, they would be in for a hard time. </p>
			<p> After all, everything started because of the Sword Dao Gate. </p>
			<p> Zhou He’s expression sank and the blood started to drain from his face. Eventually, he sighed, “I’m afraid Eminent Elder Wei Bi already knows…” </p>
			<p> As the eminent elders in the hall stared at each other, they saw the look of fear in each other’s eyes. </p>
			<p> “We have to make a report to the Wei Family no matter what. They might not blame us for anything. After all, Lord Wei Dafa was killed by that young man. Our Sword Dao Gate lost several hundred Dao Venerables too…” An eminent elder continued, “The only thing we should be worried about is that youngster.”  </p>
			<p> When they spoke about Huang Xiaolong, their chests tightened a little. </p>
			<p> They might not know Huang Xiaolong’s background, but they knew what happened. With the strength he displayed, there was no way their Sword Dao Gate could mess with him. </p>
			<p> “Relax. Wei Dafa is the second disciple of Wei Changqing. He should be in line to enter the core disciple ranks of the family, and Grand Elder Wei Changqing spent a huge amount of effort on him. Now that Wei Dafa has been killed in the Falling Water City, Wei Changqing will never choose to let things rest. He will personally head over to the city in order to kill the kid.” Another eminent elder sighed. “I heard that Grand Elder Wei Changqing comprehended three elements to the grand perfection level a few years ago.” 𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝒃𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> Zhou He shook his head. “Since the youngster could kill Wei Dafa, Wei Changqing wouldn’t be able to do a thing to him. It’s not like the kid is afraid of the Wei Family anyway.” </p>
			<p> “The only power in the celestial empire that isn’t afraid of the Wei Family would be the royal family! Don’t tell me the kid hails from the royal family…” </p>
			<p> “Probably not. If he’s from the royal family, the Wei Family definitely has news on him.” </p>
			<p> The eminent elders broke out into discussion. </p>
			<p> In one of the cities near the Falling Water City, Wei Xiaoyue and Aunt Hong heard about the news and they were shocked. They didn’t think that things would progress to such a point. </p>
			<p> “How dare he! Zhou He and the Sword Dao Gate can offend the youngster for all we care, but why did he drag our family into this?!” Wei Xiaoyue gnashed her teeth in rage. </p>
			<p> Aunt Hong sighed, “I was too rash. I didn’t think this through. Who would have thought that they would send inner disciples to deal with the matter…” She continued, “Wei Dafa is the second disciple of Wei Changqing. The man has always doted on Wei Dafa, and he’s definitely going to make a move now.” </p>
			<p> Wei Xiaoyue’s face changed. “Aunt Hong, we should tell my father everything about the young man! He has to stop Wei Bi and Wei Changqing!” </p>
			<p> If Wei Bi and Wei Changqing actually made a move to offend the youngster, their Wei Family would be in deep sh*t! </p>
			<p> “I’ll contact the patriarch right now!” Aunt Hong nodded. She knew how serious things were, and she had to send the report immediately. She contacted the patriarch of the Wei Family instantly.  </p>
			<p> After reporting the matter, she turned to Wei Xiaoyue. “Xiaoyue, the patriarch instructed me to bring you back to the family. It’s no longer safe outside.” It was clear that Huang Xiaolong’s presence had already alerted the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> “... I shouldn’t have told you to inform my father.” </p>
			<p> A helpless smile appeared on Aunt Hong’s face. “Xiaoyue, you have to be obedient. The patriarch says that he will personally send out several experts to capture you if you refuse to return. Let’s return for now. We can always come out again after a few years.” </p>
			<p> “Alright…” </p>
			<p> When the two of them started to make their way back to the family, a murderous expression could be seen on Wei Changqing’s face as he stood before Wei Bi. “I have to avenge my disciple! How dare that man kill my disciple?!” </p>
			<p> Wei Bi nodded. “We can’t let things go now that he killed an inner disciple of our family. Even if his background is shocking, he’ll have to leave his life behind today!” </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, his transmission symbol trembled and he nearly jumped in shock. After reading the message, he realized that the patriarch was summoning him and Wei Changqing. </p>
			<p> From the message, the patriarch wasn’t playing around! </p>
			<p> A weird look formed in Wei Bi’s eyes. He didn’t understand why they were summoned by the patriarch. Moreover, he was summoned along with Wei Changqing.</p>

			</title>
			<p> Wei Changqing wanted to say something when he saw the look on Wei Bi’s face, but Wei Bi spoke before he could say anything. “The patriarch sent a message for us. We are to report to him right now.” </p>
			<p> A frown formed on Wei Changqing’s face. “Just us?” </p>
			<p> Wei Bi nodded. </p>
			<p> “Did the patriarch say anything else in the message?” Wei Changqing frowned. </p>
			<p> “No.” Wei Bi shook his head and continued, “Let’s go over right now.” Since the patriarch had sent a message summoning them both, it had to be something important. </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Wei Changqing was a little more nervous as he followed closely behind the doyen to meet with the Wei Family Patriarch. </p>
			<p> When they arrived in the main hall, they saw Wei Long, the Wei Family Patriarch, sitting in the main seat with a solemn expression on his face. Wei Bi and Wei Changqing felt their hearts pounding in their chests. </p>
			<p> “We greet Lord Patriarch.” They bowed the moment they entered the hall. </p>
			<p> Wei Long nodded slightly and he gestured to the seats beside him. “Take a seat.”  </p>
			<p> The two of them slowly lowered themselves onto the chair. </p>
			<p> “I learned about everything in the Falling Water City.” </p>
			<p> They nearly jumped in fright when they heard what he said. After all, they didn’t think that the patriarch would summon them because of the matter in the Falling Water City! However, the question remained. How in the world did he learn about that?! </p>
			<p> The death of several inner disciples of the family might cause the higher ups like the doyens to frown, but the patriarch wouldn’t care about such matters! As the Wei Family Patriarch, Wei Long had more important things to deal with! </p>
			<p> Wei Bi stood up and he asked cautiously, “Patriarch, I’ll definitely deal with it personally! There’s no need for Lord Patriarch to pay attention to such a small matter! I will bring the kid down and uphold our family’s prestige!” </p>
			<p> Wei Changqing stood up as soon as Wei Bi spoke and continued, “Yes, Lord Patriarch, you can rest assured that we will never allow that brat to escape!” </p>
			<p> The two of them had evidently messed up Wei Long’s meaning. </p>
			<p> With fury burning in his heart to begin with, Wei Long snapped when he heard what the two of them said. A snort left his lips, and it was like a clap of thunder that rang in their minds. In fact, it affected a good half of the family. </p>
			<p> Wei Bi and Wei Changqing were shocked. They didn’t think that the patriarch would fly into a rage all of a sudden. From what they knew, the patriarch had a mellow temper. He only became angry when something huge happened! </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that our Wei Family can do whatever we wish in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire?! Do you really think that we are omnipotent?! Must everyone submit to us just because they appear in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire?!” </p>
			<p> Wei Bi and Wei Changqing fell to their knees instantly. </p>
			<p> “Lord Patriarch, we…” Beads of cold sweat dripped from Wei Bi’s forehead. </p>
			<p> He might be an expert who had comprehended nine elements to the grand perfection level, he couldn’t stand up to the fury of Wei Long who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level. </p>
			<p> Wei Changqing was even worse. 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝘰𝓋𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝓂</p>
			<p> A sneer left Wei Long’s lips when he saw the two trembling individuals. “Xiaoyue has been traveling around the Falling Water City with Hong Su. Just yesterday, they met the man you’re talking about. From Hong Su’s reports, there are several beasts following the kid around and every one of them might have comprehended twelve or thirteen elements!” </p>
			<p> “What?!” Wei Bi roared in fright. </p>
			<p> “Hong Su also said that the youngster might be a Son of Creation from another celestial empire.” Wei Long continued. </p>
			<p> The blood slowly drained from Wei Bi and Wei Changqing’s faces. </p>
			<p> “Do you know why I summoned you?!” Wei Long continued, “If not for my timely summons, you would have changed all the way over with guns blazing! Weren’t you planning to raid the city to capture the kid?!” </p>
			<p> Wei Bi and Wei Changqing lowered their heads and apologized, “Lord Patriarch, we were too rash! Please forgive us!” </p>
			<p> Wei Long’s rage had yet to quell and he continued, “Nonsense! You’ve grown too accustomed to using the power of the family! You were too lazy to investigate the background of the other party, and you’re lucky Xiaoyue made the report to me! If not for that, what do you think would happen?!” </p>
			<p> Wei Bi and Wei Changqing slammed their heads into the ground. </p>
			<p> “Enough. Because of all the merits you gained during your service, I’ll lighten the punishment seeing as you haven’t done anything. Both of you shall be placed under house arrest for ten thousand years! Reflect on your actions and focus on your cultivation!” </p>
			<p> Placing them under house arrest was all he could do. </p>
			<p> However, the two of them didn’t say a word as they bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> There were no secrets in the world that could be kept forever. The news of the Wei Family disciples’ death quickly reached the ears of the various powerhouses in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. There were many families curious about the Wei Family’s reaction, but they were shocked to realize that the Wei Family didn’t make any moves. </p>
			<p> Instead, the news of Wei Bi and Wei Changqing’s imprisonment of ten thousand years started to spread. </p>
			<p> Everyone became confused and rumors started to spread. </p>
			<p> Many powers started their investigation on Huang Xiaolong, but it didn’t come as a surprise that they returned empty handed.  </p>
			<p> Initially, there were many powers who continued to pay attention to Huang Xiaolong. However, he didn’t appear due to the refinement of the Universe Boat, and many powers eventually forgot about his existence. </p>
			<p> Several dozen thousand years passed in the blink of an eye, and the star dragon energy slowly started to fuse with the universe light that came from the boat. Now that so many years had passed, Huang Xiaolong managed to brand his dao soul imprint into the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Next, he retrieved the Universe Sphere. He tossed it into the eye of the grand formation on the Universe Boat, and he fully activated it. </p>
			<p> In an instant, rays of light emerged from the Universe Boat. It became pillars that rose into the skies. If not for the fact that Huang Xiaolong had laid down countless formations around them, the light would have alerted the members of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> When you're just trying to make great content at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stopped the refinement, and he looked at the gigantic Universe Boat sitting before him. He felt the power of the universe surrounding him, and it was a boundless power that contained endless might. </p>
			<p> For someone at his level, Huang Xiaolong was unlikely to be shocked by many things, his heart pounded in his chest when he felt the aura from the treasure. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat was several million feet long, and dao runes could be seen all over its body. The runes slowly converged into the eye of the formation. </p>
			<p> Walking to the prow of the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong seemed to have entered a separate space. He could feel the mysteries of the universe clearly, and it was as though he entered the space closest to the source of the universe. He had the feeling that he could touch the mysteries of the universe if he reached his hand out. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong started walking towards the eye of the formation before him, and the feeling became clearer and clearer.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3586 – Towards the Golden Sea City&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> The origin energy of the universe filled the eye of the formation. It was much higher in quality compared to pure spiritual energy, and it was at an indescribable level. </p>
			<p> Peak-level universe spiritual veins possessed pure spirit qi, and it was the best quality anyone could obtain. However, the qi around the formation of the Universe Boat was leagues ahead. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong entered the space within the formation, he felt the mysteries of the universe surrounding him. They were like tiny little golden dragons that swam around him. If not for his powerful dao souls, he might not have discovered them. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong continued to walk towards the eye of the formation as joy filled his heart. </p>
			<p> There were three layers to the formation in the Universe Boat. Since Huang Xiaolong had only completed the initial refinement process of the treasure, he could only open the first layer of restrictions. The more he cultivated in the formation and understood the mysteries of the universe, the faster he could open the second layer. </p>
			<p> Sitting down on the eye of the formation, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art. The energy around the formation charged towards him in a frenzy and they poured into the three great worlds within his body. They slowly turned into grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> A day passed just like that. 𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong noticed that the universe source energy was much easier to refine than spiritual energy from universe-level spiritual veins, and they were much more beneficial to him. He also understood more about the universe after a night of cultivation.  </p>
			<p> Even though it had only been a day, Huang Xiaolong’s understand became much deeper. It was as though he had stepped into a whole new realm. </p>
			<p> Sitting there like before, Huang Xiaolong didn’t move as he devoured even more energy. He continued to comprehend the universal laws. </p>
			<p> He immersed himself completely in cultivation, and several dozen thousand years passed in a flash. </p>
			<p> The universe source energy in the first layers was completely absorbed by Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He only stopped when he noticed that the grand cosmos energy in his body broke through the 18 billion units mark. There were also subtle changes to the grand cosmos energy and they emitted faint golden light. </p>
			<p> The golden light made Huang Xiaolong think of the middle aged man who possessed 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy beside Zhu Qiming. </p>
			<p> The middle aged man was also able to wield grand cosmos energy that emitted faint gold light. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled. Could the middle aged man also have absorbed universe source energy?! That was the only reason that could cause an evolution in his grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> However, Zhu Qiming’s status was evidently much higher than the middle aged man. Despite that, Zhu Qiming’s grand cosmos energy hadn’t experienced a transformation. </p>
			<p> If a lackey could absorb universe source energy, Zhu Qiming should be able to too! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly denied the possibility. The middle-aged man definitely didn’t experience a transformation after absorbing universe source energy. After all, it should only exist in the Universe Boat, and there was no way it could appear anywhere else in the thirteen universes! </p>
			<p> No longer bothering with the problem, Huang Xiaolong racked his brains to think of a way for the Universe Boat to produce more of such energy. </p>
			<p> The first layer of the formation probably accumulated a large amount of universe source energy after a long period of time. However, all of them were sucked clean by him during his years of cultivation. </p>
			<p> He couldn’t possibly leave the Universe Boat alone to accumulate more energy for several millions of years…  </p>
			<p> Turning to the eye of the formation, he could see a trace of universe source energy emerging every few minutes or so. If that was the case, there wouldn’t be much even after several hundred years! He would be able to refine them in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> As his brows became tightly knit together, Huang Xiaolong thought for a long time before he realized that energy probably came from the operation of the formation. There had to be some sort of power source it was drawing on, and he quickly threw a creation level pill at the eye of the formation. </p>
			<p> The eye of the formation burst with golden light, and the pill disappeared. Several hundred strands of universe source energy filled the air. </p>
			<p> With happiness blooming in his heart, Huang Xiaolong discovered how the formation worked. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he started doing several experiments and he chucked tons of herbs, spiritual veins, and universe level treasures into the eye of the formation. He discovered that only universe-level herbs and creation pills were able to produce universe source qi. As he no longer had universe-level spiritual veins on him, he could only use grand dao spiritual veins in his experiments. That was probably the reason behind the spiritual veins being useless. </p>
			<p> If he could use universe-level spiritual veins, the effects would be much greater. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the universe source energy that surrounded him, and a bitter smile formed on his face. He might have learned how the formation worked, but the price was too damn steep! A high-grade creation pill could only produce several hundred strands of energy, and he could refine it in less than an hour! </p>
			<p> By the looks of it, ten pills would only be enough to supply his cultivation for a single night! </p>
			<p> Where in the world was he supposed to get so many creation level pills?! </p>
			<p> After all, creation level pills were on a different level compared to grand dao pills! </p>
			<p> Creation level herbs might be easier to find compared to the pills, but the effects were much worse! Even if he substituted the pills with herbs, the cost would be astronomical! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate for several months in the formation, and the creation pills he had on him were completely exhausted. He left the formation and kept the Universe Boat before emerging from his room. </p>
			<p> This time, he entered seclusion for nearly a hundred thousand years! The moment he emerged, he discovered that Tao Hang had entered the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, and Tao Han’er had entered the high-level True Saint Realm! </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er had matured into an absolute beauty after a hundred thousand years, and the cute little kid from before was nowhere to be seen.  </p>
			<p> Tao Hang and Tao Han’er were overjoyed to see that Huang Xiaolong had left seclusion. </p>
			<p> “Lord!” The two of them bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Your progress is much faster than I had expected.” </p>
			<p> Of course, they could never hide their improvements from Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Smiles formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “This is all because of the five beast lords…” Tao Hang sighed respectfully. He finally got an inkling of how terrifying the five beasts really were. </p>
			<p> A sweet smile formed on Tao Han’er’s face. “Father is right! If not for the teaching of the five beas lords, we won’t be able to progress so quickly!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong asked about everything that happened during his seclusion, and he quickly declared, “Pack your things. We’re leaving.” </p>
			<p> “We’re leaving the city?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong muttered, “That’s right. We’re going to the Golden Sea City!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3587 – Tao Han’er’s Identity&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Golden Sea City?!” The two of them yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> They didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would set his sights on the Golden Sea City. </p>
			<p> “Lord, why are we going to the Golden Sea City?” Tao Hang asked. </p>
			<p> It had been so long, and the Tao Family had turned into a thorn in his heart. </p>
			<p> “What’s wrong? Don’t you feel like going back to look at how things are?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> As different expressions formed on his face, Tao Hang didn’t know what to feel. He was obviously not resigned to staying in the Falling Water City, and he had been dreaming of returning! </p>
			<p> However, despair filled his heart when he thought about Tao Xinren and the old ancestor who had comprehended four elements to the perfection level supporting him. Hesitation and fear filled his heart. </p>
			<p> After some time, he sucked in a cold breath and bowed respectfully to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord gave me a new lease on life, and I shall follow you wherever you choose to go!” </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er nodded slowly at the side.  </p>
			<p> A smile formed on Huan Xiaolong’s face. He sent them to pack their things, and he got ready to depart. Half a day later, each of them got on the back of a beast as they left their manor. The two that weren’t carrying anyone followed behind, and Huang Xiaolong knew that he would probably never return to the Falling Water City. As such, there was no point in keeping anyone in the manor. </p>
			<p> The news of their departure quickly reached the city lord. When the old ancestors of the various families heard the news, they fell to their knees in joy. </p>
			<p> “Lord, will we never come back?” Tao Han’er asked Huang Xiaolong as she looked at the city below with a reluctant gaze. </p>
			<p> “What’s wrong?” </p>
			<p> A sheepish look appeared on her face and she continued, “I’m a little sad to leave. After all, I’ve grown up here.” </p>
			<p> “You can come back anytime you like in the future.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> However, Tao Han’er shook her head. “I will follow you wherever you go. If you choose to never return, I shall not step foot in the Falling Water City again. After all, no one else is left here.” </p>
			<p> She fell silent after she spoke. Ever since she was born, she had no idea who her parents were. She was an orphan, and she was lucky to meet Tao Hang. Otherwise, she would have long since returned to the earth. </p>
			<p> “In the future, we’ll care for each other.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er nodded as tears filled her eyes. </p>
			<p> “Han’er, in the future, I will definitely get someone to look into your identity. We will definitely be able to find an answer.” Tao Hang explained. </p>
			<p> In the past, Tao Hang had been looking for Tao Han’er’s parents for as long as he could remember. He looked outside the city, and he even tried to look around in the cities in the region. Despite that, he failed to discover any news. </p>
			<p> “Father, it’s alright.” Tao Han’er shook her head. “In my eyes, you’re my only father.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang nodded solemnly. </p>
			<p> The beasts were quick and Huang Xiaolong and the others soon left the region controlled by the Falling Water City. Even so, Huang Xiaolong had already instructed the beasts to move as slowly as possible. </p>
			<p> Not too long after they left, they heard weird cries coming from somewhere in the distance. The cries caused their hair to stand on end. Dull yellow smoke rose into the air. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang and Tao Han were shocked.  </p>
			<p> “That’s corpse qi!” Tao Han looked at the dull yellow smoke and gasped. </p>
			<p> “That’s no ordinary corpse qi!” Tao Hang turned serious. He turned to Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Your Highness, should we go over and take a look?” </p>
			<p> “Alright.” </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> The three of them changed their course as they headed towards the source of the dreadful cries. </p>
			<p> Before they could even approach, countless weird creatures approached them. The creatures weren’t corpses, but they weren’t human either. Corpse qi surrounded them as they lunged at Huang Xiaolong’s group of three. </p>
			<p> “Those are Ghost Corpses from the Sea of Burial!” Tao Hang’s expression changed as he screamed. </p>
			<p> The Sea of Burial was the second most dangerous region in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. It was only second to the Sentient Mountain Range. </p>
			<p> If the Sentient Mountain Rage was the domain of ferocious beasts, the Sea of Burials would be the haven of the Ghost Corpses. They were all powerful in their domain, and the number of ghost corpses were much higher than the number of ferocious beasts. They were extremely hard to kill, and no one would be willing to fight ghost corpses for the sake of it. </p>
			<p> The beasts following behind Huang Xiaolong’s group roared and slapped the ghost corpses before they could approach. With a single slap, they were completely destroyed. Not even their bodies remained. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang felt beads of cold sweat dripping off his forehead when he saw that happened. </p>
			<p> It was said that one would suffer a miserable end if they ended as food for the ghost corpses. The ghost corpses would devour one’s soul before corroding one’s body. Death was a luxury if they fell into the hands of the ghost corpses. </p>
			<p> “Are these from the Sea of Burial?” Tao Han looked in the direction of the crushed corpses and she gasped. </p>
			<p> “They have to be. Only creatures like that would emit corpse qi.” A trace of fear formed in Tao Hang’s eyes. “However, they would never leave the Sea of Burial… Why are they here?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the place where the corpse qi was the most concentrated, and he directed the beasts over. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for another group of ghost corpses to jump at them. The ghost corpses were at the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm, but they were no match for the ferocious beasts. </p>
			<p> Soon after, they arrived only to see a group of more than a dozen ghost corpses surrounding a couple.  </p>
			<p> Tao Hang flinched when he saw the ghost corpses. He was equally as shocked when he saw the robes on the couple. “Disciples of the royal family!” </p>
			<p> Even though they looked like branch disciples of the royal family, they were enough to shock Tao Hang. </p>
			<p> Anyone who had the halo of the royal family above them possessed absolute status in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “Fellow cultivator, please lend us a hand!” The lady among the two yelled when she saw Huang Xiaolong’s party. </p>
			<p> The two of them were at the First Estee, Dao Venerable Realm, but there were several ghost corpses of similar cultivation among the group attacking them. The others were Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm ghost corpses, and the two of them wouldn’t be able to escape no matter how hard they tried. If that kept up, they would be dead by sunset. </p>
			<p> “Why aren’t you doing anything?!” The man screamed, “We are disciples of the royal family, and if you refuse to help us, you’ll be deemed a traitor of the empire!” 𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> There was a rule in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire that stated that anyone who refused to lend the members of the royal family a helping hand would be deemed a traitor! </p>
			<p> However, that referred to core disciples of the royal family, not branch disciples. </p>
			<p> There was no way the celestial empire could do anything to Huang Xiaolong as they couldn’t really pin a crime onto any random bystander. </p>
			<p> Even so, they tried their best to force Huang Xiaolong into helping them.</p>

			</title>
			<p> Tao Hang’s expression changed when he heard what they said. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Casually turning to the beast, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Save the girl.” </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, the beast reached out a paw to grab the girl. </p>
			<p> It took a mere second to pull her out of the encirclement, and when the ghost corpse in charge of attacking her lost its target, it focused on the man. </p>
			<p> The blood drained from his face. </p>
			<p> “You!” The man pointed at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “Once I escape, I’ll kill you!” </p>
			<p> The lady who was saved couldn’t help but panic when she saw that Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of helping the man. “Fellow cultivator, please save my friend.” </p>
			<p> Even though they weren’t related by blood, they were disciples of the royal family. She couldn’t sit there and watch as he was killed. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was completely impassive and he didn’t look like he was going to do a thing. Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to leave with Tao Hang and Tao Han’er, a sword light appeared from afar and slashed into one of the ghost corpses. Soon after, it reformed as it cut down the other creatures.  </p>
			<p> Several figures appeared in the distance. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> When the man saw the people who approached, a look of joy formed on his face. “Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle, you’re here!” </p>
			<p> Those who came were experts of the royal family. </p>
			<p> When the ghost corpses saw their companions dying one by one, they quickly fled the scene. In the blink of an eye, everyone was gone. </p>
			<p> “Jian Wen, are you alright?!” One of the middle aged men who arrived asked. </p>
			<p> The disciple who was saved, Jin Jianwen, gasped, “I’m alright now. If not for all of you rushing over, I’ll be dead!” He turned to Huang Xiaolong and roared, “That man over there is a problem! He could have saved me, but he chose to leave me to die! He saved Jin Xue, allowing the rest of the beasts to surround me! He’s definitely plotting against me! We have to capture him and throw him into the heavenly prison!” </p>
			<p> The experts turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with unfriendly faces after hearing what he said. </p>
			<p> “Is what he said true?” The eldest uncle of the kid, Jin Chengming, frowned. </p>
			<p> However a ray of light flashed through one of the beasts’ eyes as soon as the man spoke. It released its aura, and the world seemed to come crumbling down. The experts who came to save the man fell to their knees, and their breaths became rough. </p>
			<p> As for Jin Jianwen, a look of fear found its way onto his face. </p>
			<p> “It’s true.” Huang Xiaolong looked at all of them who were currently kneeling on the ground. “What are you going to do about it?” </p>
			<p> Jin Chengming and the others felt their bodies drenched in sweat. </p>
			<p> “We wouldn’t dare. Lord must be mistaken.” Jin Chengming hastily explained, “That’s not what we meant at all!” </p>
			<p> “Mistaken?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. </p>
			<p> The beast standing beside Huang Xiaolong casually drew a line through space and Jin Jianwen was sent flying instantly. When he landed, he no longer showed any signs of life. </p>
			<p> Jin Jianwen’s eyes were wide when he died. He didn’t think that he would be able to escape death in the hands of the ghost corpses, only to die to the beast who served Huang Xiaolong. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill a member of the Royal Jin Family in front of so many people. </p>
			<p> He might be a branch disciple, but he belonged to the royal family! Anyone who killed a member of the royal family in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire would face serious consequences! 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> Jin Chengming and the others looked at the corpse as their bodies trembled like a leaf in the wind. </p>
			<p> The female disciple Huang Xiaolong saved previously was also stuck in a state of disbelief. </p>
			<p> She was sent to deal with the ghost corpses along with Jin Jianwen by the family, and even though she had no relations with the man, she didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would kill him without batting an eyelid. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at them and snorted, “Feel free to take your revenge. I’ll be in the Golden Sea City for quite some time.” </p>
			<p> Soon after, he turned around and left. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang and Tao Han’er stared at Jin Jianwen’s corpse for a little while longer before following behind Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Tao Hang felt his mind buzzing when he thought about how Huang Xiaolong killed a member of the royal family. </p>
			<p> “Lord, the members of the Jin Family wouldn’t let this go.” Tao Hang couldn’t help but remind Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled casually. “That’s great. After all, it will make our lives much more interesting in the Golden Sea City.” </p>
			<p> At a loss for words, Tao Hang could only stare at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. </p>
			<p> “Father, you can relax. When the members of the Wei Family were killed, they didn’t dare to cause any trouble.” Tao Han spoke up from the side. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head slowly, Tao Hang sighed, “The Jin Family isn’t the Wei Family. The Jin Family is the true powerhouse in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. They will never allow anyone to challenge their authority in the celestial empire.” </p>
			<p> Smiling slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t say a word. Instead, they continued on their way to the Golden Sea City. Along the way, they would run into several ghost corpses who were strong enough to challenge Primal Ancestors. There were even a few of them who had comprehended the elements. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang frowned when he noticed the number of ghost corpses they ran into. </p>
			<p> “Something definitely happened in the Sea of Burial. Otherwise, the ghost corpses will never appear here.” </p>
			<p> “Did the Ghost Ancestor order the ghost corpses to attack us?” Tao Han asked. </p>
			<p> In the past, a war between the ghost corpses and humans happened. </p>
			<p> “It’s not likely…” Tao Hang explained, “If that was true, they would have mobilized the entire army. All the ghost corpses we ran into were pretty much alone. The largest group had several dozen of them, and they don’t seem to be under orders.” </p>
			<p> The ghost corpses in the Sea of Burial were like humans. They had their cultivators and they formed various factions among themselves.  </p>
			<p> Despite the occasional attacks, the beasts around Huang Xiaolong were there to take care of everything. With a single slap, no ghost corpses would be left standing. </p>
			<p> They didn’t slow down at all as they continued on their way towards the Golden Sea City. </p>
			<p> Since Huang Xiaolong instructed them to slow down, they only arrived after a month. </p>
			<p> They saw the giant gates of the Golden Sea City standing before them, and it was like the gates of a palace compared to the gates standing before the Falling Water City. The city was massive, and the walls around it were tens of thousands of feet tall. The entire city emitted the prestige of a celestial empire, and everyone felt a sense of awe in their hearts when they approached. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang looked at the city as complicated emotions welled up in his heart. </p>
			<p> It had been more than a hundred thousand years since he returned, but hatred filled his eyes when he thought about Tao Xinren. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said as he rode into the city. </p>
			<p> There were troops conducting checks all about, but they backed off when Tao Hang showed them the plaque of an inner disciple of the Tao Family. </p>
			<p> When they entered, Tao Hang said to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, it’s getting late. I have a courtyard in the city, and we can head over for a short break.” </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3589 – Sentence to Death&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> They quickly made their way over to the courtyard. </p>
			<p> “It’s not a huge courtyard, and there are only three small rooms…” Tao Hang revealed an embarrassed expression as he explained to Huang Xiaolong. “Please make do.” </p>
			<p> After all, his courtyard was incomparable to the manor they had in the Falling Water City. </p>
			<p> “It doesn’t matter.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “We’ll just buy every single manor around the courtyard in a few days.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang stared at him in shock. </p>
			<p> Covering her mouth, Tao Han’er giggled. She turned to Huang Xiaolong and laughed, “Do you know how much a plot of land costs in the Golden Sea City?!” </p>
			<p> “My courtyard was worth three thousand dao coins in the past.” Tao Hang shook his head and sighed, “It might be located in a secluded spot, but it should be worth a lot more now.” </p>
			<p> Three thousand dao coins was equivalent to three million holy bills!  </p>
			<p> Even though it only had three small rooms, it was considered a luxury! The manor Huang Xiaolong had in the Falling Water City was located on the busiest street, and it cost ten thousand dao coins at best! </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er gasped in fright when she heard the price of the courtyard. “That’s really expensive!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “If you auction off the jade hairpin I gave you, you’ll be able to buy a ton of residences in the city center.” </p>
			<p> After all, that was a peak-grade grand dao artifact made by a God of Creation! </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er shook her head resolutely and sighed, “Even if they give me a million manors, I won’t sell it away!” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang laughed. “If you buy a million residences in the city, you’ll be able to rent them out for an astronomical price! You’ll be able to buy anything you want!” </p>
			<p> “No! I’ll keep my hairpin…” Tao Han’er snorted. </p>
			<p> She completed the initial refinement of the artifact, but she had no idea it was a peak-grade grand dao artifact. The only reason she liked the hairpin was because it was a gift from Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw the look on her face. </p>
			<p> Several moments later, they arrived at Tao Hang’s courtyard. </p>
			<p> They were shocked to discover that the courtyard was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it turned into a storefront, and the surrounding courtyards faced the same fate. The entire street was filled with stores selling jadestones, and it was called the Xinren Jadestone Store! </p>
			<p> Xinren! </p>
			<p> Tao Xinren! </p>
			<p> Tao Hang realized what was going on the moment he saw the name of the store. Flames of rage burned in his heart. “Tao Xinren, you motherf*cker! You killed my wife and you stole my courtyard! I hereby swear I’ll stop at nothing till you’re dead!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong patted his shoulders to calm him down. He made his way over to the shop and he spoke to the attendant, “Are all of you slaves of Tao Xinren?” </p>
			<p> The attendant glared at Huang Xiaolong when he heard the unfriendly tone. He yelled, “That’s right! The owner of our shop is the core disciple of the Tao Family, Tao Xinren! Do you have a problem with that? Brat, are you here to cause trouble?” </p>
			<p> “Cause trouble?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. </p>
			<p> One of the beats approached the store and released a heaven shaking roar. As the roar left its lips, the attendant was sent flying to the end of the street. </p>
			<p> Blood leaked from the attendant’s face. </p>
			<p> “Go back and tell Tao Xinren that Tao Hang is back. He’s claiming his land. Oh right, tell him to wash his neck. We’ll go over to behead him soon.” Huang Xiaolong continued. </p>
			<p> The attendant stared at Huang Xiaolong in fright and he didn’t dare to make a peep. He turned and fled instantly. </p>
			<p> Everyone else on the street stared at Huang Xiaolong with fear. </p>
			<p> Ignoring all of them, Huang Xiaolong brought Tao Hang and Tao Han’er into the shop. Even though they changed the courtyard to a storefront, there were still two rooms in the back. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually looked around and tossed Tao Hang a spatial ring. “Go ahead and purchase every single store in the surrounding area. If they refuse to sell, pay them double. If they are still unwilling, give them three times the asking price!” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang stared at the contents of the spatial ring and his jaws dropped when he saw hundreds of millions of dao coins laying in there. </p>
			<p> “Go ahead and spend everything in there.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang stammered, “All… All of it?!” </p>
			<p> How many stores did he need to buy in order to spend all the money?! </p>
			<p> Even if he bought out all the stores along the street, he wouldn’t be able to finish spending the mountains of dao coins in the ring! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. “That’s right. Buy over every single structure surrounding us.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Was Huang Xiaolong really planning to buy over the entire plot of land in order to construct a manor?! How large would it be?! </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you planning to construct a manor using the surrounding land? You need the permission of the royal family if you wish to build such a massive structure!” Tao Hang explained. </p>
			<p> It was like the time when his Tao Family constructed their manor. </p>
			<p> The royal family restricted the size of one’s residence, and their Tao Family wasn’t the only one who were restricted. Even the peak families in the celestial empire were affected. When the Wei Family wanted to build their manor in the Golden Sea City, they had to get permission from the royal family! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed. Even if Jin Hai, the God of Creation who created the celestial empire personally appeared, he wouldn’t dare to speak out against Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Go. You don’t have to worry about things like this.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Opening his mouth slightly, Tao Hang chose to do as he said. He went around buying over all the stores, and with the power of the dao coins, everything went smoothly. Basically every single shopkeeper agreed to sell their stores, and those who refused were slapped with a fistful of money according to Huang Xiaolong’s wishes.  </p>
			<p> When Tao Hang was busy buying the shops, the attendant who was sent flying earlier returned with a ton of experts from the Tao Family. 𝑓𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝒷𝑛𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p> All of them were people who helped Tao Xinren, but there were many who were still out on a mission to kill ghost corpses running around the land. As such, a huge chunk of his power was missing. </p>
			<p> The attendant brought the experts over to Tao Hang’s original courtyard, and he roared at Huang Xiaolong, “That’s him!” </p>
			<p> “Take him down!” The expert in the lead snorted, “Bring him back. We’ll torture him with everthing we have and the young master can deal with him when he returns.” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Manager Tao Fei!” The experts bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> The instant they set foot in the shop, another one of the beasts appeared. It released a roar that caused the earth to tremble and the sound wave tore through the streets in the city. </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong was currently located in a random corner of the city, the roar caused the manors in the area surrounding them to shake. It eventually reached the ears of those in the royal palace. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3590 – Five Great Beast Kings of the Sentient Mountain Range&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The palace trembled slightly. </p>
			<p> “Who?!” The experts stationed within jumped in fright. </p>
			<p> There were countless powers situated in the Golden Sea City, and all of them were shocked by the sudden cry. They stared in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s manor in unison. </p>
			<p> In an instant, the bustling city fell completely silent. </p>
			<p> As the night was still young, the city was at its busiest. There were countless people roaming the streets, but not a single one dared to move a muscle after hearing the roar. Looks of fear formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> Experts all around opened their dao eye in order to locate the source of the roar, but none of them managed to catch a glimpse of anyone on Huang Xiaolong’s side. Not even the ancestors of the great families, or Celestial Emperor Jin Chengguang was able to. </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, should I go down personally to take a look?” Marshal Sun Fu muttered. </p>
			<p> Sun Fu was one of the ten strongest experts in the celestial empire, and he was the leader of the marshals of the empire. His status was second only to the celestial emperor! </p>
			<p> Even though he wasn’t from the Royal Jin Family, he was able to rise to the position of Grand Marshal! One could only imagine how highly he was valued by the celestial emperor.  </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang growled, “Alright. Go verify the source of the roar. Bring Jin Ding and Jin Suyuan with you.” </p>
			<p> Jin Ding and Jin Suyuan were marshals of the celestial empire, and they were part of the top ten strongest experts in the celestial empire. They had 1.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> Sun Fu was stunned for a second. He planned to go alone, but since Jin Chengguang had already made his stance clear, he could only follow the decree. Whatever the case, he would follow Jin Chengguang’s order to the letter. That was the reason behind the trust the celestial emperor had in him. </p>
			<p> The three of them charged straight for Huang Xiaolong’s manor. </p>
			<p> An hour later, they returned with their faces swollen. If not for the fact that their auras were the same, no one would recognize them in the royal palace! </p>
			<p> “You… You guys…” Jin Chengguang gasped. </p>
			<p> The three of them looked at each other with complicated emotions in their eyes. </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, the Golden Bear King of the Sentient Mountain Range was there!” Sun Fu eventually forced the words out of his lips. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Everyone in the hall jumped in fright. </p>
			<p> There were five beast kings in the Sentient Mountain Range, and all of them were experts who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level. They were extremely strong, and their physical bodies were in another league compared to those of human cultivators. They didn’t lose out in terms of cultivation either, and it was no wonder Sun Fu and the others were beaten up so badly. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang didn’t think that the roar came from the Golden Bear King! </p>
			<p> However, the beast kings would usually cultivate in seclusion in the depths of the mountain range. Why would they run over to the Golden Sea City? </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang wasn’t the only one who was confused. The experts in the hall were curious too. </p>
			<p> When everyone was stuck in a state of confusion, Sun Fu continued, “The Poison Dragon King, Silver Wolf King, Black Lion King, and the Azure Phoenix are here too!” </p>
			<p> “WHAT?!” Celestial Emperor Jin Chengguang leaped to his feet and yelled. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> All five beast kings from the Sentient Mountain Range were currently in the Golden Sea City! </p>
			<p> The faces of everyone in the hall changed. </p>
			<p> They might be able to deal with a single beast king if he came alone, but the combined strength of all five beast kings was something they couldn’t take lightly. God of Creation Jin Hai was currently away, and there was no one strong enough to deal with them! </p>
			<p> “Do you know the reason behind their appearance?” Jin Chengguang asked as panic started to set in. </p>
			<p> Sun Fu shook his head. “I am unable to figure it out. However, they’re traveling together with an inner disciple of the Tao Family, Tao Hang.” </p>
			<p> “Inner disciple of the Tao Family?!” Jin Chengguang felt the world spinning around him. How in the world did an inner disciple of the Tao Family get involved with the five beast kings?! </p>
			<p> “Yes. There’s also a couple following the beast kings around.” </p>
			<p> “A couple?!” A frown formed on Jin Chengguang’s face. </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, could it be the two lords of the Sentient Mountain Range?” Someone asked. </p>
			<p> There were two Gods of Creation in the Sentient Mountain Range, and everyone’s thoughts turned to them. </p>
			<p> It was no wonder they would think that way. After all, there was no way the five beast kings would appear in the Golden Sea City otherwise. </p>
			<p> A terrified gaze appeared in the eyes of everyone present. </p>
			<p> However, Sun Fu shook his head and denied, “According to the description, it’s not them. The girl is at the True Saint Realm.” </p>
			<p> True Saint Realm?! 𝙛𝙧𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝙤𝙫𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝓶</p>
			<p> Doubt formed in their eyes as they looked at each other quietly. </p>
			<p> “Go look into the young man.” Jin Chengguang frowned. “Investigate the relationship he has with Tao Hang and the five beast kings. I want to know the reason they’re here.” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Your Majesty!” Sun Fu replied instantly. </p>
			<p> When that was going down, Tao Hang was busy buying out everyone store on the surrounding streets. </p>
			<p> As Tao Xinren’s attendant was killed alongside the hundreds of experts he brought along with him, a light red mist filled the air.  </p>
			<p> The roar that came from the Golden Bear King helped Tao Hang out a whole lot. Not many people dared to oppose Tao Hang when he came over to buy out their store. </p>
			<p> Even so, it took quite some time to travel around the streets. Dawn had broken and Tao Hang only completed the purchase of several dozen stores. </p>
			<p> Finally, Tao Hang could no longer bear dealing with them one by one and he gathered every single shopkeeper on the streets. He dealt with the buy over procedure on the spot, and the process became a lot faster. </p>
			<p> As for the death of the disciples of the Tao Family, it started to spread through the city. </p>
			<p> “I heard that the disciples of the Tao Family were killed by the Golden Bear King of the Sentient Mountain Range! That’s where the roar came from!” </p>
			<p> “What?! Why would a beast king from the Sentient Mountain Range come to our city?” </p>
			<p> “Why would the Golden Bear King make a move on the disciples of the Tao Family?! He’s an exalted Beast King!” </p>
			<p> In the main hall of the Tao Family, doyens sat all around as an oppressive atmosphere filled the air. The brows of the old ancestor were tightly locked together, and no one dared to breathe loudly. </p>
			<p> “Have you investigated the matter?! Is the Golden Bear King really the one who killed them?” </p>
			<p> “We… We have… It really is him!” Tao Shengfei’s expression was solemn. “After the roar shook the city, His Majesty sent Sun Fu, Jin Ding, and Jin Suyuan over to verify the news. They returned in an hour with their faces beaten black and blue, and other than the Golden Bear King, the four other beasts kings were present!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3591 – Scram?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “What?!” The faces of everyone in the hall changed. Many people gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> There had never been a time in history when all five beast kings gathered. </p>
			<p> It was no wonder the royal family hadn’t done a thing! </p>
			<p> “But… Why would the Golden Bear King kill disciples of our family?!” An eminent elder asked. </p>
			<p> That was the true question they wanted an answer to. It was also the reason behind Old Ancestor Tao De’s summons. </p>
			<p> Tao Shengfei, the patriarch of the Tao Family, continued, “It’s said that the beasts kings occupied core disciple Tao Xinren’s store the moment they entered the city. Tao Xinren’s men didn’t verify their identities, and they led several hundred disciples over to kick the beast kings out of their territory…” </p>
			<p> Everyone knew what happened after that. </p>
			<p> “Why would the Golden Bear King take over their store?!” Old Ancestor Tao De was getting more confused by the minute. </p>
			<p> With their statuses, why would they bother with such a secluded area?! They could go anywhere they wanted, including the royal palace! Who would care about the storefront of a disciple of the Tao Family?  </p>
			<p> There was no way it was a coincidence. The street they were on wasn’t even located in a good area in the city! </p>
			<p> Tao Shengfei explained, “The beast kings were spotted with three other individuals. One of them was Tao Hang, an inner disciple of our Tao Family. Tao Hang offended Tao Xinren in the past, and he escaped in order to keep his life. All these years, Tao Hang has been hiding in the Falling Water City.” </p>
			<p> Those in the hall were in the upper echelons of the family, and they stared at the patriarch in a daze. </p>
			<p> Why in the f*cking world would an inner disciple of their family be traveling with the five beast kings of the Sentient Mountain Range?! </p>
			<p> Could they be here because of Tao Hang?! </p>
			<p> Tao Shengfei and the others felt their eyes widening as they turned to glare at Eminent Elder Tao Xian. Tao Xian was Tao Xinren’s grandfather, and there was no way he had no idea what Tao Xinren did. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> “This… This isn’t possible…” Tao Xian felt the world crumbling around him as his face turned green. </p>
			<p> “How in the world did Tao Hang form a connection with the beast kings?!” Old Ancestor Tao De asked. </p>
			<p> “Tao Hang was saved by a youngster when he resided in the Falling Water City, and the beast kings seem to listen to the kid.” Tao Shengfei explained. </p>
			<p> Everyone stared at Tao Shengfei in silence. </p>
			<p> “This… This… Is the youngster a lord from the Sentient Mountain Range?!” </p>
			<p> “That doesn’t seem to be the case. I asked around, and the kid doesn’t resemble the lord from the Sentient Mountain Range at all. Grand Marshal Sun Fu has also confirmed the fact.” </p>
			<p> “If that’s the case, why would the beast kings listen to him?” Another eminent elder asked. </p>
			<p> The moment the question left his lips, the entire hall fell silent. </p>
			<p> They held their breaths and a terrifying conclusion flashed through their mind. </p>
			<p> Toa Shengfei muttered, “I’ve heard that His Majesty, the celestial emperor, sent a royal statement to the youngster stating that he would pay him a personal visit.” </p>
			<p> What?! </p>
			<p> Even the celestial emperor wanted to pay the man a personal visit! How terrifying did the youngster have to be?! </p>
			<p> “But… But… The youngster refused to see him.” Tao Shengfei muttered. 𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Refused to see the celestial emperor of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire?! </p>
			<p> The members of the Tao Family felt their hearts trembling. </p>
			<p> “We managed to uncover the deaths of those of the Wei Family back in the Falling Water City. They were also killed by the Golden Bear King.” </p>
			<p> “It’s no wonder the Wei Family refused to do anything after their disciples were killed!” Tao De muttered to himself. As the old ancestor of the family, he heard a lot more news compared to the eminent elders. </p>
			<p> “Old Ancestor, this…” Tao Shengfei asked. </p>
			<p> Getting to his feet, Tao De glared at Tao Xian. “Pass down my order. Summon Tao Xinren right now! Get the hell back to the manor now!” </p>
			<p> “All of you here, we’ll bring Tao Xinren to the lord! We’ll give him a proper apology!” Turning to look at Tao Xian, Tao De continued, “We’ll also apologize to Tao Hang!” </p>
			<p> The entire upper echelon of the Tao Family would apologize to an inner disciple! </p>
			<p> If the news were to spread, they would become a laughing stock of the world! Even so, Tao De still chose to give the order. </p>
			<p> Not a single person in the hall dared to oppose the idea. </p>
			<p> In the vicinity of the Sea of Burial… </p>
			<p> Tao Xinren slayed a ghost corpse along with several other disciples, and they reveled in their victory. However, his transmission symbol trembled slightly, and he discovered that there was a message from his grandfather. </p>
			<p> As an eminent elder of the family, Tao Xian was busy most of the time. Even though he doted on Tao Xinren, he wouldn’t be able to send him a message most of the time. He jumped in joy, but when he was done reading the message, his expression froze. </p>
			<p> “Get back to the Tao Family Manor?” Tao Xinren didn’t believe his eyes. Why would his grandfather summon him back with such urgency? </p>
			<p> It was an order from the old ancestor! </p>
			<p> When that happened, the transmission symbols of the other core disciples shook. It was an order from the patriarch, and they were to capture Tao Xinren immediately! All of them were responsible for bringing him back to the manor! </p>
			<p> Their expressions became weird when they looked at Tao Xinren.  </p>
			<p> “Brother Xinren, we received an order from the patriarch to escort you back to the manor immediately. Please forgive us.” One of them spoke. </p>
			<p> Charging towards Tao Xinren, they took him down instantly. </p>
			<p> “You! This can’t be happening! I didn’t do anything wrong! Why will Lord Patriarch do this?!” </p>
			<p> The disciples were clueless, but they had to follow the orders of the patriarch. After all, going against the patriarch’s order would land them in a lot of trouble. Even though they had been hunting ghost corpses with Tao Xinren recently, they had to do as the patriarch said! </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, several days passed. </p>
			<p> After some effort, Tao Hang finally bought over the surrounding streets. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sent the five beast kings out to build the manor immediately. </p>
			<p> As the Black Lion King summoned a ball of black flames, he leveled everything in the plot of land. The Golden Bear King stomped on the ground and it became as hard as iron. The three other beast kings made their move, and a grand manor was soon constructed. </p>
			<p> The material that they used to build the manor came from the Submerged Dragon Institute, and they used the worst material they could find. Even so, the quality of the manor far exceeded the grand palace. </p>
			<p> The manor was countless times bigger than that in the Falling Water City, and Huang Xiaolong personally imprinted the mark of a blue dragon at the entrance. At the same time, he casually threw down several formations around the structure.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3592 – Assault of the Ghost Corpses&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s eyes were filled with stars when she walked around the manor. “Lord, is this really the place we’ll be staying in from now on?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “It’ll do for now.” </p>
			<p> The Golden Sea City was just a small city in the First Universe. Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to stay for long, and that was the reason he only used the lowest quality material in the treasury to construct it. </p>
			<p> As such, it was pretty much a temporary base. </p>
			<p> When Tao Hang and Tao Han’er heard what he said, they couldn’t help but stare at him in shock. The manor they were living in was more luxurious than the royal palace! </p>
			<p> “Lord, Patriarch Wei Long sent someone to request an audience with you. He wishes to apologize for Wei Dafa’s behavior, and he brought along Eminent Elder Wei Bi and Wei Dafa’s master, Wei Changqing.” Tao Hang reported. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need for that. Tell them to go back.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, Tao Hang left the main hall. As soon as he left the gates of the manor, he saw the entourage from the Wei Family several hundred meters away. 𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝓷𝓸𝙫𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p> When they saw Tao Hang, Wei Long ran over with an enthusiastic expression on his face. “Fellow Cultivator Tao Hang, what did he say?”  </p>
			<p> Complicated emotions welled up in Tao Hang’s heart. That was the patriarch of the Wei Family! Even the patriarch of the Tao Family would have to lower his head respectfully, but the man was acting humbly in front of Tao Hang! </p>
			<p> “My lord requested for all of you to return.” Tao Hang eventually spoke. </p>
			<p> Falling into silence for some time, a smile slowly returned to Wei Long’s face. “It’s alright. We’ll come another time.” After speaking, he left with the members of the Wei Family. </p>
			<p> “Lord Patriarch, the youngster might not be a God of Creation!” An eminent elder of the Wei Family spoke up. “Who knows, he might just be a junior of the two lords of the Sentient Mountain Range. That’s the reason behind the beast kings’ loyalty.” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! He might not even be a Son of Creation! For all we know, his relationship with the beast kings might be fake!” </p>
			<p> “Even if he is a God of Creation, how dare he refuse to meet the patriarch?!” Wei Tingxian, an eminent elder of the Wei Family grumbled. </p>
			<p> In fact, everyone from the Wei Family was angry. </p>
			<p> Even though Wei Long didn’t say anything, his expression said it all. He was equally as pissed off. </p>
			<p> “If he really is a God of Creation at the level of Lord Jin Hai, it won’t matter.” Wei Xiaoyue spoke up all of a sudden. “Don’t forget, he didn’t even grant the celestial emperor an audience.” </p>
			<p> The eminent elders of the Wei Family fell silent. </p>
			<p> “Xiaoyue, do you think that the youngster is a God of Creation at the large completion stage?! Is he really as strong as Lord Jin Hai?!” Wei Long pondered. </p>
			<p> “It’s very possible.” </p>
			<p> “This doesn’t seem too likely. If he really is as strong as that, we would have heard of him!” Wei Tingxian explained. </p>
			<p> “We’ll know whether or not he’s a God of Creation as soon as Lord Jin Hai returns.” A light flashed in Wei Long’s eyes. </p>
			<p> The moment the words left his lips, a heaven shaking blast caused the earth to shake. Rays of light surrounded the city as dao runes filled the skies.  </p>

			<p> The faces of those from the Wei Family changed. </p>
			<p> They could tell that the trembling came from an impact far beyond their abilities of comprehension. Clearly, someone wanted to destroy the city. It only managed to remain standing because of Jin Hai’s protective formations. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?!” </p>
			<p> Wei Long and everyone else opened their dao eye and they saw the giant army of ghost corpses hovering above the city. There were countless ghost corpses, and there were more pouring out from the massive black hole not too far away from the city. </p>
			<p> “It’s the ghost corpse army!” The members of the Wei Family gasped in shock. </p>
			<p> It was obvious that the ghost corpse army arrived through the black hole, but no one had any idea how the Sea of Burial managed to create a spatial tunnel connecting them to the Golden Sea City! </p>
			<p> How in the world did nobody notice the change?! </p>
			<p> When everyone saw the amount of ghost corpses pouring out of the black hole, they were struck speechless. </p>
			<p> The ghost corpse army was nothing like the random ghost corpses that roamed about the lands. If they chose to attack as one, a nightmare would descend on the land. </p>
			<p> “Pass down my order! Open the grand formation around the manor! Every single disciple of the Wei Family is to get ready for battle!” Wei Long roared. </p>
			<p> As soon as they heard his order, the eminent elders stared at each other silently. </p>
			<p> They would only activate the grand formation when the family was facing destruction! </p>
			<p> “Lord patriarch, the city is protected by the formation laid down by Lord Jin Hai. The ghost corpse army wouldn’t be able to shatter it…” Wei Tingxian muttered. </p>
			<p> After all, activating the formation would consume a lot of resources.  </p>
			<p> Wei Long shook his head. “Lord Jin Hai isn’t in the city right now and neither is our old ancestor. The ghost corpse army chose such a convenient time to attack and there has to be more behind it. The grand formation around the city might not be able to hold them off!” </p>
			<p> The Wei Family finally realized that things were much worse than they thought. </p>
			<p> In fact, Jin Hai heading over to the Sea of Burial might be part of the giant conspiracy! </p>
			<p> “However, our grand formation wouldn’t be able to hold them back if the city’s formation shatters…” Wei Xiaoyue frowned. </p>
			<p> If the formation laid down by Jin Hai was shattered, there was no way their grand formation could hold the assailants back! </p>
			<p> As for the grand formations of the other great families, there was nothing else to say. </p>
			<p> “Should we pass down the order for every disciple to vacate the city?” An eminent elder asked. </p>
			<p> “It’s too late for that.” Wei Long sighed. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, the entire ghost corpse army had surrounded the city. Not even Dao Venerables who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level would be able to leave, much less disciples of their Wei Family. There were too many ghost corpses, and the marshal leading them had to be peak-level experts in the Dao Venerable Realm too! </p>
			<p> “What should we do now? The moment the grand formation protecting the city breaks, we’ll all turn into food for the ghost corpses!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3593 – Why Are The Five Beast Kings Here?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When they thought about their miserable end in the hands of the ghost corpses, everyone shuddered. </p>
			<p> No one there didn’t fear death. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, a giant blast sounded in the skies once again and the strike that landed on the grand formation around the city was much stronger than the previous one. The sunlight that filled the land with warmth was replaced by darkness, and corpse qi filled the skies. </p>
			<p> The corpse qi became an everlasting smog that shrouded the lands, and it gave off a sense of pressure they never felt before. </p>
			<p> The members of the Wei Family noticed that the grand formation protecting the city was slowly being eaten away by the corpse qi. </p>
			<p> Their faces changed as Wei Long gasped, “This doesn’t seem right, this… This…” </p>
			<p> A massive figure appeared beyond the barrier as the words left his lips. Golden colored corpse qi surrounded his body, and he was nearly a million feet tall! Everyone could feel the terrifying corpse qi rolling off his body through the barrier. </p>
			<p> “It’s Lord Jin Shi!” The members of the Wei Family screamed. </p>
			<p> There were two Gods of Creation in the Sentient Mountain, and there were similarly two God of Creation Realm ghost corpses in the Sea of Burial. The two of them controlled the universe source dao and they were terrifyingly strong. Lord Jin Shi was one of them, and he was at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.  </p>
			<p> The moment he appeared, the entire city fell into chaos. Experts charged out of their manor and stared into the skies. People started to run around as they looked for a way to leave the city. </p>
			<p> A ray of light emerged from the royal palace and Jin Chengguang emerged with the various marshals. </p>
			<p> He looked at Jin Shi and roared, “Lord Jin Shi, our ancestor made an agreement with you in the past! You’re not allowed to attack our city!” </p>
			<p> The Golden Sea Celestial Empire, Sentient Mountain, and the Sea of Burial had an agreement that Gods of Creation were not allowed to take part in the battles between them. </p>
			<p> Jin Shi roared with laughter, “Agreement? I have no idea what you’re talking about.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, another figure appeared beside him. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang felt his heart dropping at the sight of the newcomer. </p>
			<p> “Lord Qin Feng!” </p>
			<p> Qin Feng was a God of Creation from the Qin Feng Celestial Empire. He was a God of Creation at the large completion stage, and they had always been at peace with the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. Who would have thought that he would join hands with Jin Shi! </p>
			<p> Yet another figure appeared all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Lo and behold, it was another God of Creation. </p>
			<p> He was from the White Island Celestial Empire, but his strength was a little lacking compared to the other two. He was close to the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, but he wasn’t quite there yet. </p>
			<p> The faces of those in the city fell into despair when they saw the three Gods of Creation standing outside the barrier. </p>
			<p> If the three of them joined hands, not even Jin Hai would be able to stand against them! Not to mention the fact that he wasn’t even there! </p>
			<p> The three of them looked at the experts of the various families running around like headless chicken. </p>
			<p> “Everyone in the Golden Sea City, listen up! We only wish to occupy the royal palace! Other than the members of the Jin Family, we’ll accept everyone who surrenders! If you choose to stand against us, we’ll feed you to the ghost corpses!” </p>
			<p> The city calmed down in an instant when they heard the terms. </p>
			<p> The old ancestors and patriarchs of the various families started to communicate among each other. </p>
			<p> There was no one who would choose to stand with the Jin Family now that their existence was threatened. </p>
			<p> When Jin Chengguang looked at the various families, rage filled his heart. However, he didn’t have time to care about them as the three Gods of Creation made their move! They summoned their creation artifacts as they slashed at the barrier. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> The earth shattered and the heavens trembled. The rays of light that protected the city started to dim. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang and those from the royal family started to panic. If they kept that up, the formation would shatter in a matter of minutes! </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, leave now! We’ll hold them back with our lives! You have to live on with the various princes!” Sun Fu yelled. </p>
			<p> “We’ll hold them back with our lives!” The marshals of the celestial empire roared in unison. </p>
			<p> However, Jin Chengguang shook his head slowly and sighed, “The space around the city has been sealed. I have nowhere to go. It seems like heaven has forsaken our empire…” </p>
			<p> Another blast resounded as the three of them landed another round of attacks on the barrier. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before the barrier cracked. The moment it did, the ghost corpse army occupied the city. </p>
			<p> The city might be large, but the number of ghost corpses couldn’t be underestimated. They swarmed the streets instantly, and the army housed in the palace were completely useless in the face of the ferocious assault.  </p>
			<p> Amidst the wretched cries, the large families chose to surrender. </p>
			<p> Jin Shi, Qin Feng, and Bai Zhou watched on as the slaughter happened. They looked on as Jin Chengguang and the marshals fought against the endless sea of enemies. </p>
			<p> The ghost corpse army moved unhindered in the city. They managed to occupy the entirety of the city, but when they arrived at a giant courtyard in the north, they were stopped by another barrier. The ghost corpses who approached were killed instantly, and not a single ghost corpse could approach ten thousand feet from the manor. </p>
			<p> The manor was like a separate space compared to the chaotic city. 𝗳𝐫𝗲𝗲𝐰𝗲𝐛𝐧𝐨𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝐨𝐦</p>
			<p> Qin Feng and Bai Zhou were shocked by the sight. </p>
			<p> Roar! </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, the three Gods of Creation saw five giant beasts charging out of the manor. They charged out like gods of war as they engaged in slaughter. Swathes of ghost corpses were killed. </p>
			<p> “Are they the beast kings of the Sentient Mountain Range?!” Jin Shi and the others gasped. </p>
			<p> Why in the world would the five beast kings of the Sentient Mountain Range run all the way over to the Golden Sea City?! </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3594 – Don’t Go Too Far&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Could the two lords of Sentient Mountain Range also be in the city? </p>
			<p> Jin Shi and the other two frowned. </p>
			<p> Thinking about the possibility, they stopped the army from approaching the manor. Cupping their fists, they slowly approached. “Are fellow cultivators from the Sentient Mountain Range?” </p>
			<p> The two lords of the Sentient Mountain Range were no weaklings. One of them was at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, and the other was at the peak of the small completion stage. Jin Shi didn’t dare to show them any disrespect. </p>
			<p> Even so, they didn’t get a reply. </p>
			<p> Jin Shi stared at the manor in silence. </p>
			<p> Just as Qin Feng and Bai Zhou were about to speak up, a voice came from inside the manor. “Take all the ghost corpses and scram! Oh right, leave behind all your creation-level herbs and pills. If you have universe-level spiritual veins, hand them over. Put your weapons down along with any creation pills you have before leaving.” </p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> His voice was firm, and there was no denying it. He was serious.  </p>
			<p> Jin Shi and the others were slightly taken aback, but rage filled their hearts the next instant. </p>
			<p> “Who the hell are you?! Why would you pretend to be from the Sentient Mountain Range?! Who do you think you are? How dare you ask us to leave our treasures before leaving?!” Jin Shi roared. </p>
			<p> Initially, they wanted to be courteous to the lords of the Sentient Mountain Range. However, they didn’t think that the other party would start with such an unreasonable request! The way he spoke was nothing short of disrespectful. </p>
			<p> However, they wouldn’t dare to make any rash moves as they had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong was. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang and the experts on his side noticed the abnormality, and they also heard what he said. None of them believed what they were hearing. </p>
			<p> “What if we refuse?” Qin Feng snorted in anger. </p>
			<p> “I strongly advise you to follow what I say. If you refuse, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the skies. </p>
			<p> Qin Feng’s temper was never great, and the axe in his hand cleaved downwards at the manor once Huang Xiaolong was done. With 3.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy powering it, the giant axe tore through the void as it appeared above the main structure. Just as it was about to break the manor in half, an ordinary looking arm appeared. He flicked his fingers once, and the giant axe was sent flying. The power behind the strike rebounded instantly. </p>
			<p> Clang! </p>
			<p> A clear ringing sound rang in the ears of those present in the city. </p>
			<p> Under the gazes of Jin Chengguang, Wei Long, and the others, the axe flew through the air and Qin Feng was sent tumbling through the air like a shooting star. </p>
			<p> No one knew how many ghost corpses he smashed into, but he created a giant crater when he finally landed. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> The city shook as various structures fell. A cloud of dust filled the air. </p>
			<p> Everyone felt their jaws dropping in fright.  </p>
			<p> Jin Shi and Bai Zhou sucked in a long breath. </p>
			<p> Qin Feng was the strongest among the three, and he had been in the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm the longest. Jin Shi had barely broken through, and he had 3 billion units of grand cosmos energy. As for Bai Zhou, there wasn’t much to say since he hadn’t entered the large completion stage. 𝒇𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> The strongest among them, Qin Feng, was sent flying with a single flick! </p>
			<p> In fact, none of them knew that that was merely one ten thousandth of Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength. No… That might even be an overestimation. If Huang Xiaolong used any more strength, Qin Feng would have exploded into a mist of blood. </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, half-step Universe Gods were nothing more than trash! Not to mention a mere God of Creation at the large completion stage. </p>
			<p> Vomiting mouthfuls of blood, Qin Feng felt his entire arm going numb. There was no feeling in his arm that held the axe, and terror assaulted his mind. </p>
			<p> The entire city fell silent in an instant. </p>
			<p> The ghost corpse army that was killing to their heart’s content froze on the spot, and so did Jin Chengguang and the marshals. They stopped whatever they were doing and they forgot that they were surrounded by million and million of ghost corpses. </p>
			<p> Jin Shi stuttered after some time, “I wonder which lord graced the Golden Sea City with your presence… We apologize for offending you! We’ll call the army back immediately!” As soon as he spoke, he called for a full scale retreat. </p>
			<p> Like a receding tide, the ghost corpse army left the city as quickly as they came. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the army leaving. </p>
			<p> Before Jin Shi and Bai Zhou could leave with their army, a figure emerged from inside the amnor. </p>
			<p> When they saw Huang Xiaolong’s young appearance, they were shocked. </p>
			<p> With his hands clasped behind his back, Huang Xiaolong looked at Jin Shi and the others. “You seem to have forgotten whatever I said.” </p>
			<p> Their expression turned completely unsightly.  </p>
			<p> As Gods of Creation, they definitely had creation pills and creation-level herbs on them. However, they only managed to obtain those treasures after a lot of effort. As for their creation artifact, it was something they would never part with. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> Their creation artifact was what Gods of Creation treasured the most! </p>
			<p> “Lord, we can give you everything other than our artifacts… After all…” Jin Shi hesitated for a moment. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was completely expressionless and he muttered, “I gave you a chance and you refused to take it. Now, I want the treasuries of your respective factions!” </p>
			<p> Their expressions changed once again. </p>
			<p> The treasuries of their factions contained wealth accumulated after countless generations! Now, Huang Xiaolong wanted all of it! </p>
			<p> “You’re going too far!” Jin Shi raged, “Don’t even think about it!” </p>
			<p> Bai Zhou continued, “Let me tell you something, we have a great relationship with Lord Zhang Yun! Don’t push us too far!” </p>
			<p> Zhang Yun was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage in the Limitless Land, and he had 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was extremely famous throughout the lands!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3595 – Meeting Lord Zhang Yun&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Qin Feng sneered, “We made a great concession when we agreed to leave the creation pills and herbs. Don’t think about getting anything more from us! Otherwise, you won’t be able to afford the consequences of offending Lord Zhang Yun!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he heard how they tried to use Zhang Yun to pressure him into backing off. </p>
			<p> “I’m going too far? Alright. I’ll show you what that actually means.” Huang Xiaolong reached out with a single hand and pulled all three of them towards himself. </p>
			<p> They were frightened when Huang Xiaolong made his move. </p>
			<p> “We’ll go all out! He might not be able to defeat all three of us when we work together!” Jin Shi yelled. After the words left his lips, golden light covered his body. The golden corpse qi he produced turned into golden corpse dragons that had sinister expressions on their faces. Corpse qi filled the air, and it was a hundred times more terrifying than the corpse qi that was once in the air. </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang and the others were taken aback when they felt the increase in power. He might be at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm after comprehending thirteen elements to the grand perfection level, but he knew that the corpse qi dragons would tear him to shreds in an instant! </p>
			<p> Jade green light emerged from Qin Feng’s body and it contained the power to affect the souls of everyone present. They felt as though their dao souls had fallen into a quagmire, and it became extremely uncomfortable. </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> As for Bai Zhou, he summoned a ball of white light that possessed the power of a trillion suns that hung high above the city.  </p>
			<p> “Die!” </p>
			<p> The three of them moved in unison, and they appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant. Jin Shi held onto an item that looked like a long bone spike. Bai Zhou used a pure white sword that could allow him to challenge Gods of Creation who just entered the large completion stage. </p>
			<p> The white sword circled Huang Xiaolong and it sliced towards the back of his head. </p>
			<p> His move was extremely unpredictable, and ordinary experts at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm might be surprised by his sneak attack. </p>
			<p> Qin Feng’s axe slashed at Huang Xiaolong’s chest and he came with a vengeance. </p>
			<p> Their combination was pretty great, and it was evident it wasn’t their first time working together. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard their assumption that they would be able to take him down when they worked together. They couldn’t even see Huang Xiaolong’s movement before they were sent flying. </p>
			<p> By the time they landed, the entire area was a mess and their bodies were covered in rubble. </p>
			<p> The three creation artifacts they held were stabbed straight into the walls of the city. </p>
			<p> When Jin Chengguang and the others saw what happened to the three Gods of Creation, waves of shock battered their tiny little hearts. </p>
			<p> Bai Zhou might not be at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, but he wasn’t any weaker than Jin Shi! When they worked together, the power of three God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage were unleashed to the maximum! Even so, they were crushed! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t even attack them! </p>
			<p> As for the marshals of the retreating ghost corpse army, they were terrified.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored everyone else as he appeared in the skies above the three of them. A gust of wind swept through the lands to reveal their sorry figures in the ground below. </p>
			<p> Blood stains covered their bodies and their faces were covered in dirt. </p>
			<p> Fear filled their hearts when they saw Huang Xiaolong standing above their heads. 𝐟𝗿𝗲𝗲𝐰𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> “You!” Jin Shi was afraid, but rage soon filled his heart. Huang Xiaolong’s strength was far beyond his expectations! </p>
			<p> With another wave of his hand, he dragged the three of them over. </p>
			<p> Soon after, their spatial artifacts were taken from them and so were their creation artifacts that were stuck in the city walls. </p>
			<p> “Who in the world are you?!” Bai Zhou roared, “Since you dare to steal our artifacts, we’ll report this to Lord Zhang Yun! He’ll hold you accountable for your actions!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhang Yun? Never heard of him…” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Searching through their dao souls, he discovered that there were special restrictions laid down on it. However, the restrictions were much weaker than the ones placed on the dao souls of Huang Sheng, Zhu Qiming, and the experts around Meng Tian. </p>
			<p> Carefully studying the restrictions around their dao souls, Huang Xiaolong realized that he had the ability to shatter them safely if he put his mind to it. He could easily brand their dao souls with his own to control the three of them. </p>
			<p> Of course, that would alert the Limitless Master as the restrictions were probably laid down by him. He might even draw the attention of the Dragon Overlord, and he decided against shattering the restrictions. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he brought the three of them towards their factions. He swept their treasuries clean without a second word. </p>
			<p> The three of them could only curse at Huang Xiaolong silently.  </p>
			<p> When they were done, Huang Xiaolong released the three of them. </p>
			<p> As they stared at his leaving figure, they gnashed their teeth in anger. </p>
			<p> “Let’s report this to Lord Zhang Yun! We’ll go to Cloud Mountain right now!” Jin Shi growled as hatred flashed in his eyes. </p>
			<p> Qin Feng and Bai Zhou nodded. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was done, he returned to the Golden Sea City only to see the Golden Sea Army cleaning up the area. </p>
			<p> “Lord, you’re finally back! The ancestors and patriarchs of the various families are currently kneeling outside the manor! They wish to meet you personally to thank you for saving the city.” Tao Hang reported the moment Huang Xiaolong returned. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s feat of defeating the three of them caused the hearts of the old ancestors to tremble. </p>
			<p> “It’s alright. Send them back to their manors. I shall enter seclusion right now.” Huang Xiaolong instructed before telling Tao Hang and Tao Han’er to stay in the city. Before Tao Hang could react, Huang Xiaolong disappeared. </p>
			<p> Now that he received the treasuries from the three great factions, Huang Xiaolong could power the grand formation on the Universe Boat for quite some time.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3596 – Meeting Jin Hai&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> A helpless smile appeared on Tao Hang’s face when he realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning on meeting those kneeling outside. He would have to play the role of the bad guy once again… </p>
			<p> When he thought about how he would send Celestial Emperor Jin Chengguang away, Tao Hang felt his head going numb. He was a mere Primal Ancestor, but he was tasked with sending the celestial emperor away! </p>
			<p> Moreover, there were members of the Tao Family kneeling outside! He was a mere inner disciple of the family, but he was going to send the old ancestor and patriarch of his family packing! </p>
			<p> Turning around, Tao Hang saw Tao Han’er staring at Huang Xiaolong’s palace and he couldn’t help but ask, “Han’er, are you alright?” </p>
			<p> Tao Han snapped back to attention and sighed, “I’m alright. Let’s go.” </p>
			<p> When they emerged from the manor, they saw a sea of people kneeling before the entrance. At a glance, Tao Hang knew that there were thousands, if not more, waiting for Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> All of them were experts in the Golden Sea City who had comprehended ten or more elements to the perfection level. Every single existence kneeling there were old ancestors or patriarchs of the great powers. </p>
			<p> In fact, they had been kneeling there for quite some time. </p>
			<p> When Jin Chengguang saw Tao Hang and Tao Han’ER leaving the manor, excitement flashed in his heart and he went up hastily. “Fellow Cultivator Tao Hang, did the lord return?”  </p>
			<p> Tao Hang didn’t dare to slight the celestial emperor and he quickly replied with his fists cupped together, “Yes, Your Majesty, he’s back… However…” </p>
			<p> Their hearts trembled when the words left Tao Hang’s lips. </p>
			<p> “The lord entered seclusion the moment he returned.” Tao Hang could only make the report truthfully. </p>
			<p> “That… How long will he be in seclusion?” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang shook his head and sighed, “I have no idea. Would all of you like to return to your residences first?” </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang’s sighed in his heart. However, he could only maintain the smile on his face as he addressed Tao Hang and Tao Han’er, “Alright. I would have to trouble you to inform me when the lord leaves seclusion. I wish to pay him a personal visit to thank him for saving the city.” </p>
			<p> “Of course.” Tao Hang bowed quickly. </p>
			<p> In the end, everyone could only return to their respective manors. Before they left, all of them bowed respectfully in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s manor. </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> The only people who acted differently were the members of the Tao Family. Tao De, the old ancestor of the Tao Family, went up to Tao Hang and smiled, “Fellow cultivator, I have already sent for the arrest of Tao Xinren! He will be brought back to the city soon, and you can deal with him as you please as soon as he’s back.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang paused for a second before thanking Tao De, “Many thanks, Old Ancestor…” </p>
			<p> Tears of joy appeared in Tao De’s eyes when he heard Tao Hang’s address. He hastily replied, “Fellow Cultivator Tao Hang, there’s no need to call me your ancestor! You can call me by my name!” </p>
			<p> When the old ancestors of the various families heard what Tao De said, weird expressions appeared on their faces. </p>
			<p> “This…” Tao Hang hesitated. </p>
			<p> “Fellow cultivator Tao Hang, our Tao Family will always await your return.” Passion ignited in Tao De’s eyes and he continued, “As long as you return, you will be the next Tao Family Patriarch!”  </p>
			<p> ?!?! </p>
			<p> He was a mere Primal Ancestor, but the old ancestor was willing to pass him the position of the patriarch! </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When everything went on outside, Huang Xiaolong had sealed himself in the grand formation of the Universe Boat. He retrieved the treasures from all three treasuries and threw them into the eye of the formation in order to produce universe source qi! </p>
			<p> Looking at the millions of strands of universe source qi, Huang Xiaolong sat down happily as he circulated all three creation arts. He started to refine the qi as he comprehended the mysteries of the universe. </p>
			<p> The three great worlds in him sucked in the universe source qi around him quickly. </p>
			<p> Several years later… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong refined the last bit of energy in the formation and he gained quite a bit during his cultivation. </p>
			<p> He purified his entire body during this round of cultivation. In the past, Huang Xiaolong experienced a shocking increase in strength as he devoured the power of Huang Sheng, Ao Wanshan, and the others using the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree and four Universe Origin Fires. When that happened, there were many hidden dangers buried in his body. They reached a terrifying level, and if not for the fact that he discovered them, things might be disastrous! </p>
			<p> If he continued to devour Huang Long Bloodlines, the hidden dangers in his body would erupt like a massive volcano! When that happened, his dao souls would shatter and his dao heart would explode! </p>
			<p> Nothing would be able to save him then. </p>
			<p> Luckily for him, the universe source qi in the Universe Boat and the various powers it contained managed to purify his body. As long as he continued to cultivate in the grand formation of the Universe Boat, he would be able to cleanse his body. When that happened, he would be able to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. </p>
			<p> He was lucky he managed to obtain the Universe Boat. Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead when realized the consequences. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong calmed himself down before leaving his palace. </p>
			<p> “Lord!” Tao Hang jumped in joy the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong’s figure. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to emerge from cultivation so soon.  </p>
			<p> “Lord!” Tao Han’re revealed a cute little smile at the side. </p>
			<p> Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Han’er is growing prettier by the day.” </p>
			<p> It was true. Perhaps it was because of her cultivation in the way of the sword, but there was a heroic aura growing around her and it accentuated her beauty. </p>
			<p> “This…” Tao Han’er blushed and she didn’t dare to look at Huang Xiaolong in the eye. </p>
			<p> “Lord Jin Hai and the old ancestor of the Wei Family, Wei Zhi, have returned to the city. When they learned of your actions, they requested an audience in order to thank you. They asked for me to notify them the moment you left seclusion…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed casually, “Alright, call them over.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang smiled when he realized that he wouldn’t have to offend the other great lords this time. “Yes, Lord!” He left the manor instantly in order to notify the experts of the celestial empire and the Wei Family. 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> “Lord, do you think I’ll ever be able to enter the God of Creation Realm with my talent?” Tao Han asked when she saw that Tao Hang was gone. </p>
			<p> Staring at her in silence, Huang Xiaolong eventually smiled, “Talent is secondary. As long as you cultivate with all your heart, you will definitely enter the God of Creation Realm someday.” </p>
			<p> With joy filling her heart, Tao Han’er nodded her head.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3597 – Top Five&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Jin Hai and Wei Zhi to arrive. Even though they were Gods of Creation, they were extremely respectful when speaking to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> In the main hall, Huang Xiaolong invited them to take a seat. </p>
			<p> “When the ghost corpse army attacked the city in the past, you managed to save the city single-handedly. We are extremely grateful to fellow cultivator.” Jin Hai stood up and cupped his fists. </p>
			<p> Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “It’s nothing.” </p>
			<p> Wei Zhi stood up soon after, and he bowed respectfully, “Our Jin Family and Wei Family managed to gather up several creation level pills, and creation level herbs. We have two universe-level spiritual veins, and we wish to present them to fellow cultivator for saving the city.” He handed over a spatial ring after he spoke. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject the gifts. </p>
			<p> “I came to the Limitless Land not too long ago, and I’m unfamiliar with the situation here. Please enlighten me.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> Getting to their feet, Wei Zhi and Jin Hai stood at attention. “We will answer your questions to the best of our abilities!” </p>
			<p> Since they heard the reports, they had their guesses that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t from the Limitless Land. After all, he was too damn strong! If he hailed from the Limitless Land, his name would have long since shocked the world.  </p>
			<p> As such, they didn’t question him about the fact that he was unfamiliar with the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he asked them many questions about the current situation. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong subdued the five beast kings in the past and looked through their memories in order to gain a clearer picture about the Limitless Land. Even so, the five beast kings weren’t Gods of Creation, and the secrets of the world were hidden from them. As experts in the God of Creation Realm, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were much more reliable when it came to information regarding the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> The first question Huang Xiaolong had was the strength of the Limitless Master. Since he was currently in someone else’s territory, he had to know how strong they were. </p>
			<p> When they heard his question, the two of them were taken aback. </p>
			<p> “The Limitless Master has two great worlds, and we are unable to estimate his strength. However, there were rumors going around that he managed to accumulate 17 to 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” Jin Hai frowned. </p>
			<p> Indeed… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong snorted in his heart. </p>
			<p> In the past, he managed to estimate the strength of the Limitless Master after looking at the restrictions in Jin Shi’s dao soul. He guessed that the man was slightly weaker than himself, and as it turned out, he was right! </p>
			<p> He continued to ask about the various God of Creation Realm experts in the Limitless Land. There weren’t too many of them with two great worlds. </p>
			<p> However, he was shocked by the fact that there were more than six thousand God of Creation Realm experts in the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> There were more than a thousand God of Creation Realm experts in the First Universe, but that was a mere fraction of those in the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> There were dozens of unexplored regions in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> Soon after, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi revealed that there were more than forty regions in the Unknown Space, and the Limitless Land ranked somewhere in the middle.  </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong asked about the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi paused for a second. They were shocked that Huang Xiaolong had no idea who the strongest expert was. </p>
			<p> “I’ve been in seclusion for a long time… I emerged recently, and I have no idea who the strongest person here is.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at [ FreeWebNovel.com ]. </p>
			<p> The two of them gasped in fright. 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝑏𝘯𝑜𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> There weren’t too many people who were like Huang Xiaolong… </p>
			<p> “The strongest experts in the Unknown Space are the Ferocious Devil, Azure Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death! The five of them are comparable in strength.” Jin Hai explained. “They are experts who possess almost 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy. As for their combat strength, it has far exceeded their current realm.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned when he heard the revelation, but it was within his expectations. They might be strong, but he had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy. With the Star Dragon Divine Tree and Universe Boat, his combat abilities had far surpassed his level. </p>
			<p> The only thing that shocked him was the fact that there were several people who managed to create two great worlds. Of course, there was no one with three great worlds. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was the only God of Creation who possessed three great worlds. </p>
			<p> As long as he had enough resources, it was a matter of time before he surpassed them! </p>
			<p> The number of Gods of Creation might be several times that of the First Universe, but there were rarely any experts at the level of Zhu Qiming and Hao Jin! </p>
			<p> There were many half step Universe Gods who had less than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> “Have you heard of Zhu Qiming?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Qiming?” The two of them jumped in fright when they heard his name.  </p>
			<p> “What’s with your reactions? </p>
			<p> A bitter smile appeared on Wei Zhi’s face. “Lord Zhu Qiming is extremely famous! He’s the son of Lord Zhu Chen, and he’s the second most talented person in the second generation of the Unknown Space! It’s said that Lord Zhu Qiming has already broken through the 14 billion units mark. It’s said that he’ll break through the 19 billion units mark as long as he sets his mind to it!” </p>
			<p> “However, it’s unknown whether or not Lord Zhu Qiming’s great worlds would experience a transformation to allow him to break through the 20 billion mark!” </p>
			<p> When the two of them spoke of the transformation, Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled. </p>
			<p> From the two of them, Huang Xiaolong learned about the reason behind the transformation of his great worlds. </p>
			<p> The most important factor behind the transformation was one’s cultivation realm being at the half step Universe God Realm. Of course, that wasn’t the only reason behind the transformation. Only a small fraction of them would be able to transform their great worlds. </p>
			<p> The higher the talent and grade of their secret art, the greater the possibility of transformation! </p>
			<p> The three of them chatted for more than an hour before they stopped. </p>
			<p> “Lord, we discovered that Jin Shi and the others went to Cloud Mountain.” Wei Zhi continued, “However, Lord Zhang Yun wasn’t available as he went to the Land of Death. He’ll only be back after a few years.” </p>
			<p> Instead of responding to the report, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Do you know where I can find universe-level spiritual veins in the Limitless Land?”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3598 – Sleepless Sea&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were stunned by the sudden question. </p>
			<p> “There’s somewhere you can try.” Jin Hai muttered, “It’s called the Sleepless Sea, but it’s located in the extreme north. The Sleepless Sea is too far away from us, and we’ll have to cross half the Limitless Land in order to get there! We’ll even have to pass through the Limitless Capital!” </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. It’s the Sleepless Sea!” Wei Zhi nodded. “There are said to be several universe-level spiritual veins in the Sleepless Sea, but it’s not a good place to go adventuring. It’s difficult to enter the Sleepless Sea, and even more so if you wish to explore its depths.” </p>
			<p> Jin Hai continued, “The Sleepless Sea is a place populated by the members of the Ocean Race. You won’t be able to avoid them if you wish to enter, and they’re no Sentient Mountain or Sea of Burial. Not even the Limitless Celestial Empire dares to piss them off!” </p>
			<p> “The Ocean King is terrifyingly strong, and even if he’s not as strong as the Limitless Master, he’s close! Moreover, he will be able to draw upon the power of the Sleepless Sea if a fight ever happens in there, and the Limitless Master wouldn't be able to do a thing to him!” </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly. </p>
			<p> “Other than the Ocean Race, there are countless ocean beasts in there. Weird universal storms sweep across the depth of the Limitless Sea, and it contains extremely powerful elements! Not even the Ocean King dares to travel around to the dangerous regions.” Jin Hai explained. </p>
			<p> Universal storms containing elements of the Jade Flame and Limitless Water was something feared by God of Creation Realm experts!  </p>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t really care too much about them since he had the number one treasure in the thirteen universes, the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> The only problem he might run into was the Ocean King. If the Limitless Master couldn’t do a thing to him, the man might prove to be troublesome. </p>
			<p> “Other than the Sleepless Sea, is there anywhere else with universe-level spiritual veins?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> The two of them thought about it for some time before Wei Zhi spoke up, “I’ve heard that Lord Lin Qiankun of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire is looking to trade away a batch of universe-level spiritual veins.” </p>
			<p> “A batch?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> Wei Zhi nodded, “Lin Qiankun is a half step Universe God, and he’s the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. His strength ranks among the top, and I’m not surprised he has a batch of universe-level spiritual veins for sale. There seems to be more than twenty spiritual veins in the batch, and two of them are top-grade spiritual veins. There are six at the mid-grade, and the others are all high-grade universe-level spiritual veins.” Wei Zhi shook his head and sighed all of a sudden, “It’s impossible to obtain the spiritual veins. He’s asking for a top-grade creation artifact, and there’s no way anyone will trade it with him!” </p>
			<p> Universe-level spiritual veins might be special, but they were useless to God of Creation Realm experts who had crossed the 10 billion units mark. A top-grade creation artifact was different. It was useful no matter how strong one became! </p>
			<p> After all, it was extremely useful to increase one’s combat prowess. </p>
			<p> That was also the reason why no one wanted to trade with Lin Qiankun. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock when he heard the condition. “Is that all he wants?” </p>
			<p> Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were shocked to see the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Did he actually possess a top-grade creation artifact?! No… The real question was if he was planning to make the trade! </p>
			<p> “Lord, that’s right. Any top-grade creation artifact will do.” Jin Hai replied. </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you really planning to trade with him?” Wei Zhi asked. “It’s not worth it to trade a top-grade creation artifact for spiritual veins!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. “Do you know of anyone else who has universe-level spiritual veins? It would be great if they’re as generous as Lin Qiankun.” 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝓷𝓸𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> A weird feeling appeared in their hearts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain seems to have a lot of spiritual veins…” Jin Hai thought for a little before answering the question. “Lord Zhou Chi entered the depths of the Land of Death many times, and he obtained a ton of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins. However, his temper is extremely eccentric and he’s extremely violent. He’s even stronger than Lin Qiankun, and it won’t be easy to convince him to do a trade.” </p>
			<p> There weren’t too many experts in the Limitless Land who managed to exceed 10 billion units of cosmos energy, but Zhou Chi was one of them. </p>
			<p> “How strong is he?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “He probably has 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy…” Wei Zhi frowned. </p>
			<p> As experts of their level would rarely reveal their cultivation base, not too many people knew how strong they were! However, Wei Zhi’s estimation should be pretty much accurate. </p>
			<p> “What about the Limitless Celestial Empire’s treasury?” </p>
			<p> Jin Hai and Wei Zhi stared at Huang Xiaolong as their jaws dropped in fright. </p>
			<p> “Limitless Celestial Empire?!” Jin Hai gasped.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the two of them and continued, “There should be quite a few spiritual veins in their treasury, right?” </p>
			<p> If Lin Qiankun could bring out twenty spiritual veins, the master of the Limitless Land should possess more than that! </p>
			<p> “We have no idea how many universe-level spiritual veins they have in the treasury… However, we can be sure they have quite a few.” Jin Hai shook his head and sighed. </p>
			<p> The two of them weren’t willing to reveal too much information about the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the looks on their faces. It seemed as though the influence the Limitless Master had on them was quite large. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he asked about the situation in the surrounding regions, especially the Land of Death. </p>
			<p> The Land of Death was located close to the Limitless Land, and in the past, the two God of Creation Realm experts of the Sentient Mountain traveled there together. Jin Hai and Wei Zhi said that Zhou Chi had entered the Land of Death in the past to obtain universe-level spiritual veins, and he became extremely curious. </p>
			<p> When they heard his question, looks of fear formed on their faces. The expert who owned the Land of Death was the God of Death himself, one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> Not a single God of Creation dared to create a city in the Land of Death as it was shrouded in death qi. As such, there was little to no information on the region. Not many experts dared to cultivate in the Land of Death too. </p>
			<p> Despite the absence of life in the Land of Death, the God of Death managed to nurture a giant army. They were called the Death God Army, and the weakest members were experts who had comprehended the elements! The Death God Army was the strongest force in the Unknown Space!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3599 – Yin Yang City&lt;/h4&gt; 𝙛𝙧𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝙤𝙫𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝓶</p>
			</title>
			<p> No one knows how many people were in the Death God Army, and not even the marshals there were privy to the information! Only the God of Death was aware of the strength his army possessed. </p>
			<p> The faces of Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were solemn when they spoke of the Death God Army. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He knew that he would break through the 20 billion units mark soon, and when that happened, he would definitely head over to the Land of Death in order to exchange pointers with the God of Death. </p>
			<p> One day later, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi left Huang Xiaolong’s manor after bowing respectfully. </p>
			<p> When he saw their leaving figures, Huang Xiaolong fell deep into thought. Since Lin Qiankun had a batch of universe-level spiritual veins up for grabs, he had to pay the man a visit. </p>
			<p> It might not be worth it for others to make the trade with Lin Qiankun, but that wasn’t the case for Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> He had tons of top-grade creation artifacts! </p>
			<p> Kun Feng, Kai Dong, Hong Xuan, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong possessed one each. All of them belonged to him after what happened in the First Universe. </p>
			<p> Adding on the two flying ships in the Creation Palace, he had seven top-grade creation artifacts from the First Universe alone!  </p>
			<p> There was also Huang Sheng and Yu Long. All in all, he had more than ten top-grade creation artifacts on him, and they were completely useless! He might as well trade them for some treasures. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Huang Xiaolong summoned Tao Hang and Tao Han’er. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at [ FreeWebNovel.com ]. </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you really planning to go to the Yin Yang Celestial Empire?!” Tao Hang and Tao Han’er were taken aback by his sudden decision. </p>
			<p> The two of them had always been afraid that Huang Xiaolong would leave the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, and it seemed that the day had come. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. From what Jin Hai and Wei Zhi said, Lin Qiankun has a batch of universe-level spiritual veins he wishes to trade. I’ll make a trip over there in a few days.” </p>
			<p> “We will follow you to Yin Yang City!” Tao Han’er said. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly and sighed, “No. You can stay here and continue to cultivate in peace. I’ll get Golden Bear, Poison Dragon, Silver Wolf, and Black Lion to stay behind to guide you in your cultivation. After I leave, you can look for Jin Hai and Wei Zhi if you run into any trouble. I spoke to them earlier, and they will definitely solve any problem you run into.” </p>
			<p> In fact, he didn’t have to say anything and the two of them would help Tao Hang and Tao Han’er anyway. </p>
			<p> However, Tao Han’s eyes started to turn red as tears threatened to fall from them. “I really wish to follow you to Yin Yang City!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second and he stared at her silently. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang quickly pulled her sleeves and he cried, “Han’er, you’ll only inconvenience the lord if you follow him over!” </p>
			<p> Tears started to stream down her face, and Huang Xiaolong quickly waved his hands in response. “There’s nothing inconvenient about it. However, I won’t be staying there for long. In the future, I’ll head over to the Ice Mountain to meet Zhou Chi. I might even go to the Sleepless Sea! If you follow me around, your cultivation will be affected!” </p>
			<p> “We’ll cultivate well even if we follow you around…” Tao Han’er pouted. </p>
			<p> Falling silent for a moment, Huang Xiaolong eventually sighed, “Alright. When we arrive in Yin Yang City, you can stay there for some time to cutivate. When I go to the Ice Mountain and Sleepless Sea in the future, you won’t be able to follow me anymore. It’s too dangerous.” </p>
			<p> “Alright!” Tao Han’er revealed a brilliant smile after hearing what he said while complicated emotions filled Tao Hang’s heart. </p>
			<p> Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left for Yin Yang City with the two of them and the five beast kings. </p>
			<p> Jin Hai and Wei Zhi led the experts of the various families to see him off. </p>
			<p> When they looked at his leaving figure, Wei Zhi spoke softly to Jin Hai, “Brother Jin Hai, do you really think Lord Huang is a half step Universe God?” </p>
			<p> Half step Universe God?! Jin Chengguang and the others nearly fainted when they heard his evaluation. </p>
			<p> The members of the Tao Family felt their legs going soft. </p>
			<p> “Perhaps…” Jin Hai paused for a second before answering. He wasn’t sure himself. </p>
			<p> After all, only half step Universe Gods would possess top-grade creation artifacts. </p>
			<p> Jin Hai turned to stare at everyone and he growled, “We merely made guesses about Lord Huang’s strength. None of you are allowed to spread rumors! If Lord Huang hears anything out there, he’ll definitely settle the score with you!” </p>
			<p> Jin Chengguang and the others quickly swore an oath to keep themselves in check. </p>
			<p> Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and the others left the territory of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> They were still quite some way away from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, and Huang Xiaolong decided to use the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. </p>
			<p> Since the Blue Dragon Flying Ship had already surpassed the level of top-grade creation artifacts, it took them less than a month to arrive. As soon as they entered the territory of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the flying ship. </p>
			<p> They rode on the beast kings as they headed towards the capital. </p>
			<p> After several days, they arrived. </p>
			<p> As Lin Qiankun was the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land, his status was something Jin Hai couldn’t begin to compare to. Jin Hai barely entered the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, and Lin Qiankun was already a half step Universe God! Yin Yang City was several times the scale of Golden Sea City! </p>
			<p> “It’s so crowded here!” Tao Han’er couldn’t help but exclaim the moment they arrived. </p>
			<p> The two of them felt like country bumpkins now that they entered Yin Yang City.  </p>
			<p> Tao Hang and Tao Han’er gawked at the structures along the street. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the look of excitement on Tao Han’er’s face. “I’ve heard from Jin Hai that there’s a dish called the Bathing Phoenix in the city. Let’s try it later tonight.” </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiao Long was an expert at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, he still loved to enjoy delicacies. </p>
			<p> “Alright!” Tao Han’er jumped in joy. </p>
			<p> As for Tao Hang, he chuckled slightly, “Back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, I heard many experts talking about the Bathing Phoenix. It’s said that that’s one of the tastiest dish in the Limitless Land, and it costs three million dao coins for a single serving!” </p>
			<p> “Three million dao coins?!” Tao Han’er was stunned. </p>
			<p> She was a mere True Saint, and ten thousand dao coins was a fortune to her! Much less three million… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed, “We’ll look for Jin Hai’s manor in the city before going for dinner!” </p>
			<p> When Jin Hai learned that Huang Xiaolong was headed there, he gave Huang Xiaolong the manor he had in the city! The manor was something he purchased a long time ago, and it had been empty since he bought it.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony as he accepted the gift. After all, a manor might be unattainable for ordinary experts, but for experts at the God of Creation Realm, purchasing a manor in a capital city was nothing special. It’ll probably cost him some spare change, nothing more.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3600 – Prince Ying Wuyou&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was in no rush as he enjoyed a stroll through the city on the back of the beast kings. </p>
			<p> Three hours later, they arrived in front of Jin Hai’s manor. </p>
			<p> As a God of Creation at the large completion stage and the ancestor of a celestial empire, Jin Hai’s manor was located in a pretty good spot. It might not be in the center of the city, but it was close! The manor was in no way lacking to the manor Huang Xiaolong constructed in the Golden Sea City. </p>
			<p> A residence in the city would cost an astronomical amount to a creed as it would probably be priced at ten billion dao coins. If they wanted a manor in the heart of the city, it would probably double. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong opened the restriction around the manor and strode in. </p>
			<p> “Golden Manor!” Two words shone brightly on the entrance of the manor. </p>
			<p> Jin Hai personally inscribed the words on the manor, and the prestige of a God of Creation could be felt coming from it. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaoong casually imprinted a blue dragon beside the words before entering the main hall of the manor. </p>
			<p> “This place is huge!” Tao Han’er gasped after they toured the manor.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded to himself. The manor was comparable to the one he built in the Golden Sea City, and Jin Hai definitely remodeled it after the purchase. He used creation level treasures to strengthen the area. </p>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong casually built his manor in the Golden Sea City as he didn’t plan to stay for long. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t do anything to the manor itself, but he chose to lay his own formations. After an afternoon of work, he completed the formations around the Golden Manor. </p>
			<p> Leaving the manor, the three of them left for the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion. </p>
			<p> We are FreeWebNovel.com, find us on google. </p>
			<p> The Bathing Phoenix Pavilion was located in the middle of the city, and it took them less than half an hour to arrive. </p>
			<p> As soon as they did, they saw a sea of people seated in the pavilion. The main hall itself was like a mini city, as people streamed in and out of the entrance. </p>
			<p> “How can there be so many people?! Are they all here for the Bathing Phoenix? She thought that there wouldn’t be many people due to the sky high price of the dish, but she couldn’t be more wrong. </p>
			<p> She frowned, “There might not be any seats for us in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nearly broke out in laughter. “There might not be any seats on the first and second floor, but there are definitely some seats for us on the higher floors!” </p>
			<p> There were four stories in total, and anyone could enter the first and second stories if they had enough money. As for the third floor, one would only enter if they were a powerhouse in the Limitless Land. Old ancestors and patriarchs of the large families would be able to get a seat there, and only God of Creation Realm experts of those relation to Gods of Creation would be able to enter the fourth floor. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the main hall. They noticed that there were ten thousand seats on the first floor, and every one of them was filled. The same could be said for the second level. </p>
			<p> When they tried to approach the third level, the experts of the pavilion stopped Huang Xiaolong’s party courteously and asked for their identity plaques. </p>
			<p> Getting Tao Hang to show his identity plaque of the Golden Manor, the experts of the pavilion could feel the aura of a God of Creation instantly. Respectful looks appeared on their faces as they invited Huang Xiaolong’s group up to the fourth floor. </p>
			<p> The decorations on the third and fourth floor of the pavilion were completely different from that of the main hall. When the experts of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion brought them up to the fourth floor, they were allowed to choose any seat they fancy. Top-grade tea was served immediately, and they behaved extremely respectfully. </p>
			<p> Less than a fifth of the fourth floor was taken up as everyone there had some relationship with God of Creation Realm experts. As a Primal Ancestor and True Saint, Tao Han’er and Tao Hang, stood out immediately. No one knew how they were related to a God of Creation. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was the worst as he looked like an ordinary mortal. </p>
			<p> Many people stared at the group as they guessed the identity of the three newcomers. </p>
			<p> Ignoring all of them, Huang Xiaolong spoke to the experts of the pavilion, “Send up three Bathing Phoenixes. Get us a table of your signature dishes, and bring us a jar of your best wine each.” </p>
			<p> The expert from the pavilion hesitated for a moment. “A jar of our best wine will cost you a hundred million dao coins! It’s extremely expensive, and not even guests who can enjoy a table here will order them…” </p>
			<p> “Oh. It doesn’t matter.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> The expert of the pavilion quickly left to prepare the order. 𝓯𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝒃𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> On one of the tables in the corner, a young lady was seated elegantly with two old ladies standing respectfully behind her. </p>
			<p> The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, the young lady had been observing him. She spoke to the two old ladies behind her, “The youngster is really interesting. He brings along his slaves in the Primal Ancestor Realm and True Saint Realm for dinner, and he even ordered them a Bathing Phoenix each.” </p>
			<p> Experts who were able to get a table in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion definitely had attendants who had comprehended the elements, and they would be Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables at the very least. That was the first time anyone saw a Primal Ancestor and True Saint enjoying dinner on the fourth floor. </p>
			<p> One of the old experts sniggered, “What a joke. The youngster really doesn’t care about his reputation.” However, her tone changed suddenly, “Princess Yi, that might be the case, but he’s definitely not someone we can deal with.” </p>
			<p> The other old expert nodded, “I used a secret art to look into the youngster’s strength earlier. I’m afraid he’s stronger than we can imagine.”  </p>
			<p> The young lady gasped softly in response, “Does that mean that the youngster is someone who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level?” </p>
			<p> Both experts standing behind her were Dao Venerables who had comprehended the elements to the grand perfection level and closed in on 1.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy. If they weren’t able to see through Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he had to be a supreme expert. </p>
			<p> They nodded their heads slowly. </p>
			<p> “How do you think he compares to Ying Wuyou?” She asked all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> They were taken aback. </p>
			<p> “This youngster is definitely far from being able to match up to Prince Ying. However, I sent someone to investigate his identity, and the kid used the plaque of the Golden Manor in order to enter the fourth floor. Jin Hai has a lot of sons, but Jin Chengguang is the only one who has comprehended all thirteen elements to the perfection level. The young man is no Jin Chengguang.” </p>
			<p> A look of doubt formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> Before anyone could say anything else, commotion broke out in the fourth floor of the pavilion. </p>
			<p> “Prince Ying Wuyou has arrived!” </p>
			<p> Everyone looked at the entrance of the fourth floor, and a youngster clad in silver robes slowly entered. There was a faint smile on his face, and he exuded a special type of pressure. The moment he arrived, he noticed Princess Yi and he made his way over.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3601 – I Wish to Meet Them&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Ying Wuyou was the grandson of Ying Ze, a God of Creation! He was also an expert who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level. </p>
			<p> God of Creation Ying Ze was a half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. He might not be an ancient existence like Lin Qiankun, but his strength was comparable to the old expert. As Ying Ze’s grandson, Ying Wuyou had an ample amount of resources. With his talent and strength, his reputation in the surrounding celestial empires was large! </p>
			<p> Ying Wuyou followed his father, Ying Wan to the Yin Yang City in order to request for Princess Lin Yi’s hand in marriage. </p>
			<p> Even though Princess Yi was an expert who had only comprehended twelve elements to the perfection level, her talent was no joke. Her great looks attracted a lot of suitors, and the Sons of Creation of the various celestial empires wished to obtain her hand in marriage. </p>
			<p> Ying Wuyou smoked when he arrived before her. “Little Sister Yi, you’re here!” </p>
			<p> Lin Yi got to her feet and she nodded slightly, “Big Brother Wuyou…” </p>
			<p> The experts behind her called out respectfully, “We greet Prince Ying Wuyou!” </p>
			<p> He nodded and sat down beside Lin Yi. He got the experts of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion to send up three bathing phoenixes before speaking to Lin Yi. “My father tried the dishes here in the past, and he has been craving them ever since. I’ll bring two of them back for him, and I hope Little Sister Yi won’t find it weird.” </p>
			<p> Lin Yi smiled, “Of course not. Big Brother Wuyou is such a filial son…” 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎 </p>
			<p> They started chatting with each other casually after Ying Wuyou placed his order. </p>
			<p> In fact, Lin Yi knew the reason behind Ying Wuyou’s appearance in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. She didn’t hate the man, but she didn’t like him either. </p>
			<p> Of course, their families would benefit if they were connected by marriage, and she was merely a pawn in the grand scheme of things. </p>
			<p> Despite that, Lin Yi’s eyes would unconsciously drift over to Huang Xiaolong’s table as they spoke, and Ying Wuyou’s attention was quickly drawn over. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> When he noticed that Tao Hang was a Primal Ancestor and Tao Han’ER was a True Saint, he was shocked. </p>
			<p> “Do you know them?” He asked. </p>
			<p> Lin Yi shook her head and muttered, “Nope. But he looks pretty interesting. He brought a Primal Ancestor and True Saint over to the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion for a meal.” </p>
			<p> One of the old ladies behind her continued, “The youngster came up here using the plaque of the Golden Manor.” </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Ying Wuyou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. “So he’s from the Golden Manor…” </p>
			<p> He knew that Jin Hai was a God of Creation at the large completion stage, but that was nothing in his eyes. His grandfather, Ying Ze, was a half step Universe God, and his father was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. No matter who it was, they were people who could crush Jin Hai with a single finger. </p>
			<p> When he learned that Huang Xiaolong came from the Golden Manor, he chuckled, “He’s definitely trying to draw attention to himself. What a joke.” </p>
			<p> One of the old experts behind Lin Yi laughed, “Prince Ying, you’re right!” </p>
			<p> “He’s pretty interesting…” Lin Yi giggled. “He doesn’t care about what others think, and that’s pretty hard to come by!” </p>
			<p> A frown formed on Ying Wuyou’s face when he heard her tone. Jealousy filled his heart. </p>
			<p> He looked at Huang Xiaolong once again, and the gaze in his eyes became even more unfriendly when he saw his casual appearance. </p>
			<p> As thoughts flashed through his mind, the experts of the pavilion brought him his food. </p>
			<p> “Go there and call that man over.” Ying Wuyou pointed at Huang Xiaolong and commanded. “Tell him to bring his slaves over, and say that I wish to meet them.” </p>
			<p> His words were harsh, and it was as though he gave them an imperial decree. </p>
			<p> The expert of the pavilion hesitated for a second, but he chose to follow whatever Ying Wuyou said. He strode over to Huang Xiaolong’s table with his hands trembling slightly. The Bathing Phoenix Pavilion might be backed by a God of Creation, but he was only at the large completion stage! He was far from comparable to Ying Ze! </p>
			<p> Lin Yi frowned when she heard the way Ying Wuyou spoke. “Brother Wuyou, why do you wish to meet the young man? This is the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, and if anything happens, your father might be displeased with your actions.” </p>
			<p> “From what I’ve heard, he’s not easy to deal with.” </p>
			<p> Flames of jealousy burned in Ying Wuyou’s heart when he heard what she said. However, he maintained the smile on his face. “There’s no need to worry. I only wish to talk to him. I won’t do anything else.” </p>
			<p> Lin Yi opened her mouth slightly, but she chose to swallow her words. </p>
			<p> The expert from the pavilion eventually arrived at Huang Xiaolong’s table and he bowed slightly. “Young master, Prince Ying Wuyou wishes to meet you. He hopes you can bring your subordinates over too.” His tone was polite as he knew that he couldn’t offend someone from the Golden Manor. </p>
			<p> The experts sitting on the fourth floor turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Ignoring the man completely, Huang Xiaolong took a swig of wine. “Who the hell is that. Does he know me? Go and tell him that I’m trying to enjoy my meal here. If he dares to affect my appetite, he’ll die a sorry death.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might be soft, but his words rang in the minds of those sitting around. Of course, Ying Wuyou was no exception. </p>
			<p> They stared at him in a daze. Lin Yi felt her head spinning, and so did the two experts standing behind her. </p>
			<p> A weird light flashed in her eyes when she looked at Huang Xiaolong. Didn’t he know who Ying Wuyou was? Not even Jin Hai would dare to say what Huang Xiaolong just said! </p>
			<p> “Brat, are you crazy?”  </p>
			<p> “Not even Jin Hai would be able to save him this time… Heh, he might even drag the Golden Sea Celestial Empire into the depths of hell!” </p>
			<p> Everyone broke out into discussion. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong used the plaque of the Golden Manor to enter the fourth floor, many people learned of his connection to Jin Hai. </p>
			<p> With a chilly light flashing through his eyes, Ying Wuyou roared, “Brat, you better crawl over here right now to apologize! I’ll spare your life on behalf of Jin Hai, but if you refuse, you won’t be leaving this place today!” </p>
			<p> Killing intent rageed in his heart when Huang Xiaolong disrespected him in front of Lin Yi and the various experts sitting in the hall. </p>
			<p> Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong, curious about his choice. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on Lin Yi’s face. She felt that the youngster was too rash. </p>
			<p> Slowly placing his cup down, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Didn’t I tell you not to affect my meal? Too bad you’re retarded.” Huang Xiaolong casually shook his arm and the wine in his cup turned into ten streaks of silver light that shot towards Ying Wuyou. </p>
			<p> The light entered his body in an instant. </p>
			<p> With his body freezing up, a look of disbelief could be seen on Ying Wuyou’s face. When the silver light faded, he could feel his life force disappearing along with them.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3602 – Who Killed My Son?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Lin Yi, who was seated beside him, looked at the silver streaks that emerged from his body and noticed his life force draining. </p>
			<p> Sons of Creation from the other celestial empires were equally shocked at the sudden change in situation. No one expected Ying Wuyou to die just like that! </p>
			<p> A moment later, someone stuttered, “Prince… Prince Wuyou is dead… What’s going on?!” </p>
			<p> By the time he spoke, Ying Wuyou’s body had crumbled into specks of dust. </p>
			<p> “Prince Wuyou is dead! Someone killed Prince Ying Wuyou!” Someone screamed and their voice rocked the entire pavilion. It was as though the world was crashing down on them. </p>
			<p> Indeed, Ying Wuyou’s death was a disaster that could affect most people in the Limitless Land. Unfortunately, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t one of them. </p>
			<p> As the Son of Creation of the Ying Ze Celestial Empire, he was also the most treasured grandson of the man himself! Many God of Creation Realm experts estimated that he would enter the God of Creation Realm before long, and he might even be able to do it in the upcoming million years! </p>
			<p> However, he was killed in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! No, he was killed in a restaurant in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! </p>
			<p> The news was sure to rock the Limitless Land.  </p>
			<p> If the Yin Yang Celestial Empire didn’t handle this well, a war between the two great empires might begin! </p>
			<p> When Ying Wuyou was killed, Celestial Emperor Ying Wan was chatting happily with Celestial Emperor Lin Feng in the Yin Yang Palace. </p>
			<p> They were speaking about the marriage between their children, and Lin Xian chuckled, “Wuyou is a dragon amongst men! It’s Lin Yi’s honor to be betrothed to him!” </p>
			<p> After all, the marriage would benefit both parties. Lin Xian was extremely happy with Ying Wuyou talent. </p>
			<p> That wasn’t all. No matter how talented one was, they wouldn’t be able to compare to Ying Wuyou in terms of background! However, Lin Xian looked at it, Ying Wuyou was the best son-in-law he could get! </p>
			<p> Ying Wan roared with laughter, “Brother Lin Xian, I know that Lin Yi is the apple of your eye. It’s Wuyou’s honor to gain her favor.” </p>
			<p> The two of them chuckled happily. </p>
			<p> “Alright. I’ll agree to the marriage! However, let’s wait for the two little brats to return before asking for Lin Yi’s opinion.” Lin Xian smiled. </p>
			<p> “Of course.” Ying Wan laughed. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, the marriage was basically set in stone now that Lin Xian had agreed to it. </p>
			<p> When Ying Wan thought about it, happiness bloomed in his heart. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, a young expert ran into the hall in a fluster. He started yelling long before he arrived. “Father, something happened! Something big happened!” </p>
			<p> The person who came running into the hall was Lin Xian’s second son, Lin Shaowei. He was also Lin Yi’s second brother. </p>
			<p> Seeing the weird look on Lin Shaowei’s face, Lin Xian frowned, “What are you so panicky?! Hurry up and greet your Uncle Ying Wan!” </p>
			<p> Kneeling before his father, Lin Shaowei stuttered, “Father, something… Something bad happened to Big Brother Wuyou!”  </p>
			<p> “What?!” Lin Xian and Ying Wan yelled in unison. 𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝓷𝓸𝙫𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p> “What happened to Wuyou?!” Ying Wan asked as a bad premonition filled his heart. </p>
			<p> Gulping in terror, Lin Shaowei started to hesitate. </p>
			<p> “What are you waiting for?!” Lin Xian roared. </p>
			<p> “Big Brother Wuyou was… He was killed in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion!” Lin Shaowei knew how serious things were and he forced the words out of his mouth. </p>
			<p> Ying Wan felt the entire world spinning around him. </p>
			<p> Equally as shocked, Lin Xian stared at his second son in silence. </p>
			<p> However, Ying Wan’s eyes turned completely red in the next instant as killing intent filled his heart. “I’ll f*cking exterminate your bloodline for killing my son!” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, he soared into the skies and turned into a streak of light that charged straight towards the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion. </p>
			<p> He released his aura completely, and the city trembled under the might of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. In an instant, every single expert in the city, including the Sons of Creation, felt the fury of a supreme expert. The rage of someone at his level wasn’t something everyone could take on. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian hastily followed behind Ying Wan. </p>
			<p> On the fourth floor of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, everyone felt Ying Wan’s aura long before he arrived. </p>
			<p> “That’s Celestial Emperor Ying Wan! He definitely learned what happened here and he’s rushing here as we speak! We have to leave now! We can’t get caught up in this!” </p>
			<p> “His Majesty is a God of Creation at the grand completion stage with 7.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy! God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage would be crushed if he comes after them!” </p>
			<p> Everyone in the pavilion started to make their escape. </p>
			<p> However, Ying Wan was too damn fast. He arrived long before everyone could leave, and the ground sank several inches the moment he arrived. The weight of a mountain seemed to crush everything in the vicinity.  </p>
			<p> Those who failed to escape in time fell to their knees. </p>
			<p> “We greet Your Majesty, Celestial Emperor Ying Wan!” </p>
			<p> Regardless of who it was, everyone keeled respectfully. Even Lin Yi and the two old experts behind her got to their knees. </p>
			<p> “Who was the one who killed my son?!” Ying Wan’s bloodshot eyes scanned the crowd and he roared with rage. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at the man as he continued to enjoy his wine and food. He said casually. “I killed your son. Are you here to take revenge for him?” </p>
			<p> Ying Wan locked on to Huang Xiaolong when he heard the voice, and killing intent filled his heart. “I’ll kill everyone related to you and exterminate your bloodline!” A giant palm appeared in the air as terrifying flames surrounded it. It swept towards the pavilion as endless power came crashing down on the lands. </p>
			<p> Everyone looked at the giant palm as their legs went soft. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually waved his cup as streaks of silver starlight formed in the space before him. They shot towards the giant palm and pierced through the powerful attack before landing on Ying Wan’s chest. </p>
			<p> The God of Creation who was at the grand completion stage, the mighty Celestial Emperor of the Ying Ze Celestial Empire, was sent flying the moment he was struck. </p>
			<p> When Lin Xian saw a figure shooting towards him, he dodged in fright. The shock in his heart peaked when he recognized Ying Wan’s face. Ying Wan was like a meteor that tore through countless structures before finally landing on the ground.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3603 – Meeting The Blue Dragon Young Master&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The structures Ying Wan tore through were carefully constructed by several Gods of Creation in the Yin Yang City, and it existed for an endless amount of time! Now, it was shattered by Ying Wan’s sorry figure. </p>
			<p> Everyone in the city heard the resounding blast that rang through the skies. </p>
			<p> As rubble rained down on the lands, Everyone ran about frantically, trying to dodge the pieces. The debris wasn't made from any ordinary material, and many of those who were struck by it vomited mouthfuls of blood. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian stood high in the air as he looked at Ying Wan who was buried under several feet of rubble, and shock filled his heart. He quickly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong who was still enjoying a cup of wine in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion. </p>
			<p> The Sons of Creation who hadn’t left the pavilion looked at Huang Xiaolong in utter fear. </p>
			<p> Lin Yi and the two experts standing behind her couldn’t believe their eyes. Wasn’t the young man someone who used the identity of the Golden Manor? Wasn’t he Jin Hai’s son or someone related to him?! How in the world could someone at his level defeat Ying Wan with a wave of his hand?! </p>
			<p> Silence fell upon the land. </p>
			<p> When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Ying Wan got up from the pile of destruction. The armor on his body was close to shattering, and there were multiple dents on it. It was clear Huang Xiaolong’s previous strike caused them. </p>
			<p> “You?!” Ying Wan stared at Huang Xiaolong in equal parts terror and anger. The killing intent in his heart had long since diminished, and he snapped back to reality. Anger clouded his judgment earlier, but Huang Xiaolong’s revelation of strength forced him back to reality.  </p>
			<p> “I’ll spare your life seeing as you were clouded by your anger. If you try this again, I’ll kill you for real!” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> His voice rang loud and clear in the ears of those present. </p>
			<p> Hatred and rage crossed Ying Wan’s heart, but reason took over. He managed to force himself to calm down as he asked, “Who are you?!” </p>
			<p> “You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> “Alright, I’ll remember that!” Ying Wan snorted. He branded Huang Xiaolong’s title into the deepest part of his soul. </p>
			<p> After he spoke, Ying Wan didn’t bother speaking to anyone else as he disappeared into the horizon. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian wanted to ask him to stay, but Ying Wan moved too quickly. Lin Xian could only stare at Ying Wan’s leaving figure with complicated emotions. When Ying Wan left, he didn’t bother looking at Lin Xian at all. In his heart, the Yin Yang City was equally as responsible for his son’s death. </p>
			<p> Sighing silently, Lin Xian didn’t know what to say. Whatever the case, Ying Wuyou died in his city. He definitely had to be responsible for the matter. </p>
			<p> “Are you the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in his ear. </p>
			<p> Jumping in fright, Lin Xian quickly snapped back to attention. He bowed respectfully, “That’s right, Lord Blue Dragon.” Even though Huang Xiaolong called Ying Wan to address him as the Blue Dragon Young Master, Lin Xian didn’t have the guts to do that. </p>
			<p> One could see that he was extremely fearful of Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “I’ve heard that your father wishes to trade a batch of universe-level spiritual veins for a top-grade creation artifact. Is that true?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth agape. </p>
			<p> Weird emotions filled his heart. Could the man before him be there to carry out the trade?! </p>
			<p> Was it possible that the man who dealt with Ying Wan came all the way over to the city in order to make the trade with the Yin Yang God of Creation?! </p>
			<p> “Yes… That is indeed my father’s intention.” Lin Xian hesitated for a moment before explaining, “He is currently in the Limitless Celestial Empire due to the trouble caused by the members of the Ocean Race and the Ocean Beasts. The Limitless Master gathered all the experts he could find in order to think of a countermeasure.”  </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun’s absence didn’t shock Huang Xiaolong at all. After all, he discovered it the moment he entered the city. </p>
			<p> “He might not be here, but the universe-level spiritual veins should be here.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Don’t try to bullsh*t me and tell me that your spiritual veins are not kept in your treasury.” </p>
			<p> Lin Xian’s expression froze. That was indeed an excuse he was about to use. </p>
			<p> “My father has to be the one to make the decision, and we should wait until he returns from the Limitless Celestial Empire.” </p>
			<p> Ying Wuyou died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, and Ying Wan had barely left. If he chose to make the trade with Huang Xiaolong, he might start a war with the Ying Ze Celestial Empire! </p>
			<p> No matter what happened, he had to wait for Lin Qiankun to return before making a decision! </p>
			<p> “Send a report to your father right now. Tell him that I’m willing to make the trade. When you receive his reply, you’ll be able to make the trade in his stead.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “This…” A hesitant look appeared on Lin Xian’s face. “Before he left, he mentioned that no one would be allowed to disturb him! He will decide on anything after he returns.” </p>
			<p> “When will he be back?” </p>
			<p> “I… I have no idea… He didn’t mention anything about it.” Lin Xian stuttered. 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> It was clear he wasn’t planning to give Huang Xiaolong a proper answer at all! </p>
			<p> Appearing before Lin Xian all of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong released his aura. By the time Lin Xian noticed that someone was standing before him, he discovered that he wasn't able to move a single muscle! </p>
			<p> Staring at Lin Xian coldly, Huang Xiaolong growled, “I see what you’re doing. Do you really think that you can ease your relationship with the Ying Ze Celestial Empire by wasting my time? What makes you think that you can afford to offend me?” </p>
			<p> A chill ran down Lin Xian’s spine and he hastily explained, “Lord… Lord Blue Dragon, I…” </p>
			<p> “Send a message to Lin Xiankun right now. I’ll wait for him here.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Yes, yes… I’ll contact my father right away!” Lin Xian no longer dared to pull any stunts. He retrieved his transmission symbol and sent a report on everything that happened to Lin Qiankun.  </p>
			<p> In the Limitless City, Lin Qiankun was chatting happily with other half step Universe Gods when he received the message. After reading the report, he was shocked. </p>
			<p> “Blue Dragon Young Master?! He killed Ying Wuyou and injured Ying Wan with a wave of his hand… He wishes to trade a top-grade creation artifact with me?” </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> Those sitting around became curious when they saw the strange look on his face and one of them couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Qiankun, this…” </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun hesitated for a moment before showing them the report. </p>
			<p> They were astounded when they read it. </p>
			<p> “No one has ever heard of a God of Creation in the grand completion stage or above called the Blue Dragon Young Master…” Someone in the hall muttered. “Could he be from another region?” </p>
			<p> He turned to Lin Qiankun and sighed, “Since we have nothing else to do, let’s follow fellow cultivator Lin back to the Yin Yang City. Let’s meet this Blue Dragon Young Master!” </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun revealed a smile and he chuckled happily, “If Lord Chen Huanzhi is willing to accompany me, things would be great!” </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi was a half step Universe God who accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Even though he hadn’t reached the 11 billion mark, his combat abilities were far stronger than his cultivation level. Lin Qiankun had nothing to worry about now that an expert of Chen Huanzhi’s level was willing to follow him back to the city.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3604 – Universe Treasure&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Soon after, Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun left the hall as they returned to the Yin Yang City. </p>
			<p> Even though they were both half step Universe Gods, the distance between the Limitless City and the Yin Yang City was great! They needed half a year in order to return. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to make the trade. After he finished his meal in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, he returned to the Golden Manor. </p>
			<p> As for Lin Xian, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother troubling the man. He released Lin Xian after he left. </p>
			<p> After entering the Golden Manor, Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion. He walked towards the eye of the grand formation in the Universe Boat before throwing in all the creation pills and herbs he obtained from Jin Hai and Wei Zhi. Universe source qi started to emerge from the formation, and he quickly absorbed them into his body. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was cultivating in peace, Ying Wan stood before his father in the Ying Zi Celestial Empire and wept, “Father, you have to take revenge for Wuyou!” </p>
			<p> Ying Ze allowed Ying Wan to get to his feet before muttering, “He’s definitely backed by some other half step Universe God if he dares to kill Wuyou. Even if I personally appear, I might not be able to do anything.” </p>
			<p> “We can’t kill him, but we can kill those related to him!” Ying Wan seemed to have thought of something and he cried out, “He brought two slaves out with him to the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, and they are in the Primal Ancestor Realm and True Saint Realm! They seem pretty important to him and he’ll definitely feel the pain when we kill them!” </p>
			<p> Killing a Primal Ancestor and True Saint was nothing to God of Creation Realm experts like themselves.  </p>
			<p> Ying Ze nodded his head slowly, “Alright, pass down the order. As long as his slaves leave his side, kill them!” </p>
			<p> Ying Ze’s transmission symbol trembled all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> After scanning through the report, Ying Ze’s face lit up. </p>
			<p> “Father, this…” Ying Wan couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> “Lin Qiankun sent me a message earlier…” </p>
			<p> “Isn’t he part of the problem?! How dare he contact you?” Ying Wan’s expression sank when he heard that it was someone from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> As Ying Wuyou was killing in the city, he lumped all of them together with Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Ying Ze waved his hand slightly and sighed, “You can’t blame Wuyou’s death on them. Moreover, Lin Qiankun told me that he’s rushing back to the city right now with Lord Chen Huanzhi!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Chen Huanzhi?!” Ying Wan jumped in joy when he heard the name. “As long as Lord Chen Huanzhi makes a move, that little b*stard is dead!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right, at best, the man who calls himself the Blue Dragon Young Master is an ordinary half step Universe God. If I join hands with Lin Qiankun, he might be able to escape. However, with Lord Chen Huanzhi, he wouldn’t be able to resist! We’ll head over to the Yin Yang City in a few days. The moment Lord Chen Huanzhi arrives, we’ll make our move!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, father!” Ying Wan bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Half a year passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Universe Boat, it was about time for them to arrive. His estimations were pretty accurate. </p>
			<p> He summoned Tao Hang and Tao Han’er after appearing. </p>
			<p> “Lord!” They bowed respectfully when they saw him. </p>
			<p> After the incident in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, the fear and respect they had for him increased several folds.  </p>
			<p> “Did anything new happen recently?” Huang Xiaoming asked Tao Hang. </p>
			<p> “Nothing much happened. The Yin Yang Celestial Empire probably sealed off the news. Nothing special happened in the past half a year, and the only noteworthy thing that happened was due to the Sleepless Sea. The Ocean Beasts have been attacking several regions around the sea, and many people were affected.” </p>
			<p> “There were even Dao Venerables who comprehended the elements who were killed in the skirmishes!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong continued, “Do you know the reason behind their rampage?” </p>
			<p> The Ocean Race and the humans have always lived in peace. They hadn’t caused trouble in a long time. </p>
			<p> Now, even Dao Venerables were falling in the battle between them! There was no way their conflict was small. </p>
			<p> “The patriarch of the Hydra Fish Race seemed to have personally passed down the order for the ocean beasts to attack. We have no idea why he gave the order…” Tao Han’er interrupted them all of a sudden. “There seems to be many rumors going around, and there are some who said that a Son of Creation in the Limitless Celestial Empire stole a priceless treasure from the Ocean Race! There are others who said that the grandson of an important figure in the Ocean Race was killed!” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang continued, “There are others who say that the treasure stolen was a map that indicated countless universe-level spiritual veins. The treasure map is also said to contain the location of a universe artifact!” </p>
			<p> “Oh? Universe artifact?” Huang Xiaolong raised his brows when he heard what they said. </p>
			<p> There were thirteen universe artifacts born in the thirteen universes, and he obtained the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires. There were ten of them left! </p>
			<p> Before he entered the Unknown Space, he took a trip around the other universes in order to look for resources, but he failed to locate a universe artifact. </p>
			<p> “Yes…” Tao Hang nodded. “However, we have no idea if that’s true.” </p>
			<p> “Do you know which treasure it is?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “No.” </p>
			<p> Falling deep into thought, Huang Xiaolong thought that it was really possible for the map to record the location of a universe artifact. However, he had no idea which it was, and Huang Xiaolong finally made up his mind to capture several God of Creation Realm experts to serve as his subordinates. His information network was really lacking after he came to the Unknown Lands. </p>
			<p> The most important thing he had to do was to obtain universe-level spiritual veins. The universe artifact could wait as he already had the Universe Boat and the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> Two figures tore through the skies all of a sudden as they approached the city. They were Lin Qiankun and Chen Huanzhi!  </p>
			<p> Ying Ze and Ying Wan appeared from the void the moment they appeared. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Lord Chen Huanzhi!” They cupped their fists in greeting. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi wasn’t a mere half step Universe God. He was also a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. The Gods of Creation in the Limitless Land wouldn’t dare to slight him no matter where they were. </p>
			<p> Of course, his strength played a huge part in that. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi nodded slightly at the two of them. 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> Ying Ze and Ying Wan greeted Lin Qiankun next. </p>
			<p> Looking at them, Lin Qiankun sighed, “I’m extremely sorry for what happened…“ </p>
			<p> Ying Ze shook his head and groweld, “This has nothing to do with the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! Everything happened because of the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Killing intent flashed in his eyes when he mentioned Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go meet the Blue Dragon Young Master…” Chen Huanzhi interrupted them all of a sudden.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3605 – Why Should I Respect You?&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The four of them charged into the city at once. </p>
			<p> When the four of them entered the city, Lin Xian led the experts of the celestial empire over to welcome them. </p>
			<p> “We greet the Lord Ancestor, Lord Chen Huanzhi, Lord Ying Ze, and Lord Ying Wan!” </p>
			<p> Lin Xian bowed respectfully as the others fell to their knees. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun allowed them to get to their feet, and he asked, “Is the Blue Dragon Young Master still in the Golden Manor?” 𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝒏𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> “Yes.” Lin Xian replied instantly. “He hasn’t left since the incident happened.” </p>
			<p> “That’s great.” Ying Ze sneered. “Blue Dragon Young master… You better not disappoint me.” </p>
			<p> They left for his manor and the experts of the celestial empire followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for them to arrive.  </p>
			<p> When Chen Huanzhi opened his dao eye, he noticed the grand formations around the manor and he gasped softly, “Did he lay down the formations himself?!” </p>
			<p> Even though the formations were casually laid down by Huang Xiaolong, ordinary God of Creation Realm experts would never be able to do anything like that! Even half step Universe Gods like himself might not be able to create such powerful formations! </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun nodded his head and sighed, “The formations around the manor are really intricate. If I join hands with Ying Ze, we might need half a day to shatter them…” </p>
			<p> Of course, if Chen Huanzhi were to help, they wouldn’t take that long. </p>
			<p> Ying Ze’s voice rang through the skies. “Blue Dragon, Lord Marshal Chen Huanzhi has arrived! Why aren’t you out here to welcome him?! Do you really want us to shatter the formations around your manor before you emerge?!” </p>
			<p> His words rang through the city and he was clearly smearing Huang Xiaolong’s reputation. </p>
			<p> A flash of light appeared from inside the Golden Manor before Ying Ze could continue speaking. </p>
			<p> “That’s him! Lord Chen Huanzhi, that’s the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Lin Xian exclaimed when he saw the figure. </p>
			<p> When they laid their eyes on him, a look of confusion formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “Who might you be?” Chen Huanzhi broke the silence. </p>
			<p> Sweeping his gaze across those present, Huang Xiaolong noticed Ying Wan immediately. He saw the look in his eyes, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer, “Are you going to come at me together? Or are you going to take turns to get beaten up?” </p>
			<p> He was naturally referring to Chen Huanzhi, Lin Qiankun, and Ying Ze. Everyone else there were like flies compared to the three. </p>
			<p> Even though Lin Qiankun and Ying Ze had decided to work together before they confronted Huang Xiaolong, they were stunned when he called them out. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi was equally as stunned. </p>
			<p> No matter what, all three of them were half step Universe Gods. Every single one of them was a peak level expert in the Limitless Land and if the news of them ganging up on someone were to spread through the lands, they would turn into laughing stocks! </p>
			<p> “You’re not worthy of Lord Chen’s attention.” Ying Ze snorted, “Brother Qiankun and I will be more than enough to take you down. Let’s see how strong you really are!” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, he leaped at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun didn’t hesitate as he followed closely behind.  </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi didn’t move a muscle as he wanted to see if the two of them could actually hold Huang Xiaolong back. </p>
			<p> Even though Lin Qiankun hadn’t broken through the 10 billion units mark, he was the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. His combat abilities far surpassed any half step Universe God. </p>
			<p> Ying Ze summoned a curved blade in his hand and Lin Qiankun used a long whip. The curved blade in Ying Ze’s hand was a top-grade creation artifact, but Lin Qiankun’s whip was not. Even so, it neared the top-grade creation artifact level. His lack of top-grade creation artifacts was the reason he wanted to make a trade with his universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> “Bring out your weapon!” They stood before him and snorted. </p>
			<p> “My hands are more than enough to deal with you.” Huang Xiaolong ignored them as he slowly raised his fists. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi was slightly shocked when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. The two of them were equally as stunned. When experts whose strength were comparable sparred, the difference between using a creation artifact was huge! </p>
			<p> The only way he would be able to take them on would be if he was much stronger than them! </p>
			<p> Ying Ze and Lin Qiankun started to hesitate when they looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Slowly looking at each other, they came to a decision. </p>
			<p> Ying Ze soared through the skies and his blade sliced at Huang Xiaolong’s neck. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun didn’t remain idle as his whip tore through the space at it shot towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. </p>
			<p> The two of them were half step Universe Gods, and the strength they possessed was out of this world. Their attacks were extremely quick and they contained a terrifying amount of power. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually stopped the blade when it was a single inch away from his throat and he grabbed the whip with his other hand. Slightly shaking his arms, the two of them were sent flying in an instant. </p>
			<p> Two explosions rang through the skies as they smashed into the earth. </p>
			<p> Cracks started to spread through the city and the tremors rocked the entire region. </p>
			<p> Ying Wan and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in fright. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi felt a bad premonition creeping up his heart. </p>
			<p> With a single gesture, Huang Xiaolong dragged Ying Wan towards himself. He stared at the man with a cold gaze.  </p>
			<p> Ying Wan’s body trembled subconsciously when he faced Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “I spared your life once when you came looking for me in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion. I told you that I’ll kill you if you try this again.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “It seems as though my advice has fallen on deaf ears.” </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> With fear in his heart, Ying Wan screamed, “Lord… Lord Chen Huanzhi, please save me!” </p>
			<p> “Blue Dragon Young Master, please spare him on my behalf…” Chen Huanzhi opened his mouth to plead for mercy on Ying Wan’s behalf, but he was cut short. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shattered Ying Wan’s body with a single punch. </p>
			<p> The death of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage was no small matter. The skies trembled and rays of gold rained down on the land. A shockwave that contained the power to shatter the earth rocked the city. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape. </p>
			<p> After killing Ying Wan, Huang Xiaolong turned to Chen Huanzhi. “Why should I spare him because you’re here? Do you really think you’re someone worthy of my attention?” </p>
			<p> “Wan’er!” Ying Ze’s scream came from the pile of dentist on the ground, and he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong with his eyes completely red.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3606 – Think About It&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Ying Ze who was no longer thinking straight and he decided to end it in a single punch. The moment his fist landed on Ying Ze’s chest, the world seemed to lose its color and everyone watching the battle felt the space freezing around them. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> Piercing straight through Ying Ze’s chest, Huang Xiaolong’s fist emerged from his back. Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun saw Ying Ze’s dao heart shooting through the skies. It emitted rays of light before exploding in mid air. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> When Ying Wan was killed previously, his golden blood rained down on the land as a shockwave powerful enough to shake the city swept through the lands. Ying Ze was a half step Universe God, and he was in a completely different league compared to Ying Wan! When his dao heart exploded, it was as though a giant meteor had crashed into the city. </p>
			<p> The city shook violently and Lin Qiankun had no choice but to use his power to forcefully counteract the tremors. Chen Huanzhi assisted him and they managed to stop the quaking city. Even so, the Yin Yang City had nearly split into two. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s arm was still in Ying Ze’s chest, and everyone stared at him like he was some sort of monster. The scene was far too shocking, and even Lin Xian, the celestial emperor of a super faction nearly wet his pants. The marshals and generals who came with him felt the world slowly spinning around them. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi wanted to fly into a rage when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said earlier, but when he saw Ying Ze’s dao heart exploding in mid air, the anger he felt dissipated instantly. He was utterly stunned. </p>
			<p> As a half step Universe God, Ying Ze’s body was terrifyingly strong. Even so, it was shattered with a single punch!  </p>
			<p> Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong with terror in his eyes, Ying Ze tried to circulate his grand cosmos energy but he was unable to. The great world he created felt completely frozen, and he was like a helpless baby before Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “In my eyes, you’re no different from your son and grandson.” Huang Xiaolong snorted. </p>
			<p> Indeed. Killing a half step Universe God and a Dao Venerable posed the same level of difficulty to Huang Xiaolong. He could end their lives effortlessly. </p>
			<p> After he spoke, Huang Xiaolong sliced Ying Ze’s head off. It rolled towards a patriarch of a great family in the Yin Yang City. </p>
			<p> When the patriarch looked at Ying Ze’s severed head, the world went dark around him. A puddle of liquid formed under his legs. </p>
			<p> Releasing a ray of universe origin fire, it appeared above Ying Ze’s severed head. Miserable cries shook the skies as Ying Ze’s hair was burnt off. </p>
			<p> “This?!” Chen Huanzhi and the others frowned. </p>
			<p> There wasn’t any type of flame that could harm a God of Creation when they reached such a high level. </p>
			<p> However, the flame Huang Xiaolong summoned had the ability to slowly eat away at Ying Ze’s physical body! One could only imagine how strong it was! </p>
			<p> It was no wonder Chen Huanzhi and the others would be frightened! </p>
			<p> If the flames could devour Ying Ze’s body, it could also harm those present! </p>
			<p> Under their terrified gaze, Ying Ze’s skull turned into a pile of dust. </p>
			<p> The flame Huang Xiaolong summoned was the Vermillion Bird Fire and it was more than enough to deal with Ying Ze. </p>
			<p> The four Origin Divine Fires were the strongest flames in the universe. They were the source of all flames that existed in the universes, and not even half step Universe Gods would be able to resist it. </p>
			<p> Ying Ze’s dao soul emerged and it tried to escape.  </p>
			<p> With a swipe, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Ying Ze’s dao soul. He tossed it into the Sun Moon Furnace before incinerating his entire body. </p>
			<p> The curved blade he summoned earlier along with his spatial artifacts appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. </p>
			<p> He didn’t bother scanning through every item in Ying Ze’s spatial artifact, but he turned to look at Lin Qiankun. </p>
			<p> Fear bloomed in his heart when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s gaze. </p>
			<p> “Your son should have informed you that I came all this way to make the trade with you. From the looks of it, you don’t intend to trade for a top-grade creation artifact. You planned to join hands with Ying Ze to kill me here…” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun’s expression changed and he waved his hands hastily, “Lord Blue Dragon, there’s a misunderstanding! I am more than willing to make the trade, and Ying Ze’s attempt on your life was a huge mistake! I had nothing to do with it! In fact, Lord Chen Huanzhi and I didn’t plan to attack you at all!” 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi nodded, “Fellow Cultivator Lin is right. We bear no ill intent.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sneered as he glanced at Lin Qiankun from the corner of his eye, “Do you think I’m delusional? Was it an illusion when you attacked me earlier with Ying Ze?” </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun’s face flushed red and he didn’t know how to respond. </p>
			<p> With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong dragged Lin Qiankun over to himself. </p>
			<p> “You should have seen Ying Ze’s end. Your eyes don't deceive you. That’s one of the four Universe Origin Fires, and the one I used was the Vermillion Bird Origin Fire.” </p>
			<p> “It is widely accepted that God of Creation Realm experts are unkillable. Their dao souls were eternal, and their physical bodies were indestructible. However, that isn’t absolute. Would you like to have a taste of my flame?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “If your physical body is exterminated by the flame, you will never be able to form another body!” </p>
			<p> “I’ll give you two options.” </p>
			<p> “One, you’ll drop all your defenses and I’ll brand your dao soul! In the future, you’ll be my subordinate.” </p>
			<p> “The only other option is to end up like Ying Ze!”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong continued, “You better think this through.” </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun stared at him in shock. </p>
			<p> “We have already submitted to the Limitless Master! Our dao souls are branded by his restrictions!” Lin Qiankun hesitated. </p>
			<p> Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able to submit to two masters unless their soul brands were removed. </p>
			<p> “That’s not your problem. All you have to do is to make a choice.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> When you're just trying to make great content at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> When they heard what he said, they started to hesitate. If they chose to resist, they would end up like Ying Ze. If they chose to submit, they would betray the Limitless Master. Could Huang Xiaolong be strong enough to survive the wrath of the Limitless Master?” </p>
			<p> “Relax. If you choose to submit, the Limitless Master won’t be able to detect the soul brand I lay down.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “I’m far stronger than you can ever imagine.” </p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun gasped in fright. Could the Blue Dragon Young Master be stronger than the Limitless Master?!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3607 – Treasure Map&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> This novel is available on FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> When they thought of the possibility, their breaths started to quicken. </p>
			<p> That was the level of a supreme overlord! </p>
			<p> He would be a peak-level existence in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> Even though half step Universe Gods were known as the strongest existences in the God of Creation Realm, they knew that they were merely ants in the face of such terrifying experts. At best, they were slightly bigger ants. </p>
			<p> No matter how big an ant was, it was just an ant. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun thought about what Huang Xiaolong said to Ying Ze earlier, and they realized that Ying Ze, Ying Wan, and Ying Wuyou basically possessed the same level of threat to him. They were nothing more than specks of dust he could get rid of whenever he wanted! </p>
			<p> To supreme overlords, that was indeed the case. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun who were hesitating started to feel their hearts calming down when they thought of the possibility of Huang Xiaolong being a supreme overlord.  </p>
			<p> Eventually choosing to live, they chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong. They released their defenses around their dao souls and allowed him to lay down a soul brand. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t shatter the Limitless Master’s restrictions when he did his thing. Instead, he laid down another restriction that hid his control over the two. </p>
			<p> With that being the case, he would be able to control the two of them without the Limitless Master discovering anything off. </p>
			<p> With his current strength he didn’t wish to clash head on with the Limitless Master. After all, he only had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> He didn’t stop there. He laid down restrictions in the dao souls of those from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. He used the same method to hide his actions from the Limitless Master. </p>
			<p> The ancestors and patriarchs of the great families in the celestial empire were completely ignored by Huang Xiaolong. He wasn’t worried that they would spread the news of what happened as Lin Qiankun and the others would take care of it. </p>
			<p> After Lin Qiankun submitted, he quickly retrieved the universe-level spiritual veins from the treasury. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a stingy person, and he allowed Lin Qiankun to pick a top-grade creation artifact. </p>
			<p> When Lin Qiankun saw Huang Xiaolong bringing out more than ten top-grade creation artifacts, he was shocked. Chen Huanzhi and the other God of Creation Realm experts were equally as stunned. </p>
			<p> Eventually, Lin Qiankun chose Kai Dong’s weapon. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and the others quickly retrieved their universe-level spiritual veins when they learned that Huang Xiaolong was no miser. </p>
			<p> As someone who had broken through the 10 billion units mark, Chen Huanzhi was also a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. His net worth was definitely comparable to Lin Qiankun, and Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when he saw more than thirty spiritual veins sitting before him. </p>
			<p> As for the others, they took out whatever they had. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong counted sixty-three universe-level spiritual veins in total. </p>
			<p> It was an unexpected surprise, and Huang Xiaolong wasn’t complaining.  </p>
			<p> Initially, he thought that he would only be able to obtain the spiritual veins Lin Qiankun put up for trade. Now, he managed to obtain more than three times the amount! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong gave Chen Huanzhi ten leaves from the Star Dragon Divine Tree. They were much more precious compared to the Star Dragon Scales and they were useful to experts at his level. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi bowed profusely when he received the treasures. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong soon asked Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun about the matter of the ocean beasts’ attack. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun looked at Chen Huanzhi as the latter was a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. Chen Huanzhi knew much more than him. </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi replied respectfully, “The Limitless Prince stole the Yin Yang Treasure Map from the Hydra Fish Race. It’s said that one will be able to locate the Yin Yang Flame Wheel if they manage to decipher the location!” </p>
			<p> “Oh?!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun and the others were equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> Even though the map was stolen, no one knew what treasure it led to. They didn’t know that it was the Yin Yang Flame Wheel and it was the first time they were hearing about it. </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Chen Huanzhi nodded. “The Limitless Prince and the Limitless Master have been trying to figure out the location of the treasure, but to no avail.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. </p>
			<p> The Limitless Master had more than a hundred sons, and the Limitless Prince was the youngest son in the family. He was the son the Limitless Master doted on the most. 𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> “How strong is the Limitless Prince?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “His strength crossed the 10 billion mark a long time ago, and he has two great worlds. I’m no match for him.” Chen Huanzhi’s expression turned serious. “There are many people who speculate that he crossed the 12 billion mark.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised. After all, Zhu Qiming had already crossed the 14 billion units mark. It was normal for the Limitless Prince to reach the 12 billion units mark  </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about the strength of the Limitless Celestial Emperor. </p>
			<p> The Limitless Celestial Emperor was the oldest son of the Limitless Master, and he was equally as competent. </p>
			<p> “His Majesty is a little stronger than the Limitless Prince. After all, he cultivated for a much longer time!” Chen Huanzhi replied, “His Majesty’s talent is second only to the prince..” </p>
			<p> Out of all the sons the Limitless Master had, the Limitless Prince boasted the highest talent. The Limitless Celestial Emperor was slightly worse. </p>
			<p> Half a day later… </p>
			<p> Chen Huanzhi and the others left before Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion. With the spiritual veins he obtained this time, he would be able to sustain his cultivation for more than several hundred thousand years! </p>
			<p> Universe source qi gushed out from the eye of the formation, and Huang Xiaolong sat in the middle of the space quietly. </p>
			<p> Circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art, the universe source qi poured into his body. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion, the battle between the Ocean Race and the humans became more intense. They were at the cusp of breaking out into a full blown war with the Limitless Celestial Empire. Experts from the other regions charged into the Limitless Lands when they received news that the Yin Yang Treasure Map was stolen by the Limitless Prince. Naturally, they didn’t come to assist the Limitless Celestial Empire. All of them had their eyes on the treasure map. </p>
			<p> As more and more people poured into the Limitless Land, a storm started to brew.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3608 – Stolen!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong had no idea what happened in the Limitless Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> As he continued to refine the universe source qi, his understanding of the mysteries of the universe started to deepen. The impurities in his bloodline were slowly purified. </p>
			<p> A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> On the day when the final strand of universe source qi was refined, Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes. </p>
			<p> After the years that passed, Huang Xiaolong improved quite a lot. He felt much lighter when he got to his feet and he discovered that the impurities in his body were one tenth of what it was! </p>
			<p> He also discovered that he managed to reach the 18.4 billion mark now that he completed his cultivation session. The golden grand cosmos energy that populated the three great worlds were much more powerful than before. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong rejoiced inwardly. </p>
			<p> Moreover, he could tell that his connection with the Universe Boat had deepened significantly after so many years of cultivation. According to his estimations, he would be able to enter the second layer of restrictions after throwing in a hundred more high-grade universe-level spiritual veins. 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> After opening the second layer, he was sure that he could rid his body of all impurities.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong noticed that he was far too weak. Even though he managed to increase his strength in the past by devouring other people’s bloodlines, it was an elementary level way of improving his strength. Even with the help of the Universe Boat to purify the hidden threats in his body left behind, he would never be able to break through to the grand completion stage if that kept up. </p>
			<p> He would forever be stuck at the large completion stage, never to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm if nothing changed! </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, entering the second layer of restrictions was sure to show better effects. He might be able to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm when that happens. </p>
			<p> A moment later, he left the grand formation of the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> After a hundred thousand years, Tao Hang and Tao Han’er experienced a significant increase in strength. After all, they had the assistance of the five beast kings. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang ran over in a fluster the moment Huang Xiaolong appeared. “Lord, Lin Xian wishes to meet you the moment you leave seclusion! He has something to report!” </p>
			<p> “Alright, send him over.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> Bowing, Tao Hang ran out of the manor. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sank deep into thought. Could they have deciphered the location on the YIn Yang Treasure Map? </p>
			<p> “Lord, I…” Tao Han’er whispered from the side. </p>
			<p> “Han’er, what’s wrong?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> “I… I wish to travel to the Hengshan Mountain Range to train myself.” </p>
			<p> She had been following Huang Xiaolong all these years and she hadn’t left the manor in a long time. Even if she did, she would only travel around the city. She wanted to travel the world for a long time. </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly when he heard her request, “You should travel around to gain some experience.” </p>
			<p> Even though Tao Hang and Tao Han’er followed him to the Yin Yang City, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t been able to take care of them throughout the way. All of them were cooped up in the manor and there weren’t many chances for them to experience the world. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s face lit up when she heard Huang Xiaolong’s instructions. “Many thanks to the lord!” </p>
			<p> “Alright, I’ll get the Azure Eagle King to follow you around.” Huang Xiaolong continued.  </p>
			<p> This novel is available on &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> A sweet smile formed on Tao Han’er’s lips as she giggled slightly, “I knew that you’ll say that! Hehehe, you really do like me!” </p>
			<p> A trace of mischief flashed through her eyes. </p>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t want her to travel into the depths of the mountain range. The Hengshan Mountain Range was the largest mountain range in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, and it was much more dangerous compared to the Sentient Mountain Range back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er nodded obediently when Huang Xiaolong explained what she could do. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Celestial Emperor Lin Xian appeared and greeted Huang Xiaolong respectfully. </p>
			<p> “I heard from Tao Hang that you’re looking for me…” Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian glanced at Tao Han’er, but Huang Xiaolong interrupted him before he could say anything. “It’s alright, you can speak your mind.” </p>
			<p> “My report has something to do with the Yin Yang Treasure Map. The treasure map was stolen by the Dragon Overlord!” </p>
			<p> “The chicken man stole it?!” Huang Xiaolong blurted out before he could stop himself. </p>
			<p> Even though he had long since estimated that the Limitless Master would never be able to keep the treasure map with his strength, he didn’t expect that the Dragon Overlord would be the one to snatch it away. Huang Xiaolong frowned. If that chicken b*star went over to grab the Yin Yang Flame Wheel, his strength would increase by a whole level! That wasn’t good news for Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Lin Xian couldn’t be bothered with what Huang Xiaolong was thinking. He felt the world collapsing around him when he heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed the Dragon Overlord. </p>
			<p> That was one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space they were talking about! Huang Xiaolong called him a chicken man! </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s lips curled upwards as she burst out laughing. </p>
			<p> A bitter smile slowly formed on Lin Xian’s lips. If the Dragon Overlord heard what Huang Xiaolong called him, he would probably fly into a rage… No. He would probably fly into a rage even without Huang Xiaolong’s provocation. </p>
			<p> “When did the chicken freak snatch the map?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Since his mouth slipped, there was no point in upholding formalities. </p>
			<p> “Not too long after you entered seclusion, Lord Dragon Overlord personally arrived. Even with the grand formation around the empire, the Limitless Master couldn’t hold him back! During the battle, the Limitless Master was seriously injured. It’s said that he’s still recovering from the battle back then.” Lin Xian explained.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. As one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space, the Dragon Overlord definitely crossed the 20 billion mark. The Limitless Master only had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and there was no way he could win. </p>
			<p> That was also the reason Huang Xiaolong chose to lie low. He was still lacking when compared to the five experts. If he caught their attention, he would have to fight with everything on the line! When that happened, the existence of the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and four Universe Origin Fires would be revealed. He might be able to fight off a single one of them, but things would definitely go south the moment they ganged up on him. </p>
			<p> The only way he would be able to hold them all off would be to enter the grand completion stage. If he managed to accumulate 21 billion units of grand cosmos energy, he would be able to fight one on five with his treasures. </p>
			<p> “Also, Ying Ze and Ying Wan’s disappearance has already attracted the attention of the Limitless Celestial Empire.” Lin Xian continued, “They are currently investigating their disappearance.” </p>
			<p> If the Limitless Celestial Empire continued their investigations, they would eventually reach Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> That was what Lin Xian was afraid of. </p>
			<p> “THey can check all they want. There’s no need to obstruct them.” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t affected at all. </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, Lin Xian continued to make his other reports. He spoke about the matter where the Ocean Race called their forces back, but they didn’t concern Huang Xiaolong in the slightest. </p>
			<p> “Check if Zhou Chi is currently residing in the Ice Mountain.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Since everything was over, he wanted to take a trip down to the Ice Mountain.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3609 – Rolling Off The Mountain?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Lord Zhou Chi?! Ice Mountain?!” Lin Xian jumped in fright. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “That’s right. I’ll be heading there soon to pay him a visit.” </p>
			<p> Lin Xian had a bad premonition rising in his heart. Looking at the way Huang Xiaolong did things, wouldn’t he be going to the Ice Mountain to rob the man clean?! When his thoughts ventured this far, Lin Xian couldn’t help but observe a moment of silence for Zhou Chi. </p>
			<p> He didn’t dare to dally since Huang Xiaolong gave the order to investigate. He personally passed down the order to look into the Ice Mountain. </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong learned that Zhou Chi hadn’t left the mountain, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. If Zhou Chi was like Lin Qiankun, he would be forced to wait for the man to return. </p>
			<p> Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left the city as he traveled towards the Ice Mountain. </p>
			<p> The Ice Mountain was a mythical mountain in the Limitless Land. The ice qi that surrounded the mountain was extremely powerful, and not even Dao Venerables would be able to venture into the depths of the mountain. </p>
			<p> In fact, it was more appropriate to describe it as the Ice Mountain Range as it was made up of multiple peaks. </p>
			<p> As one of the ten strongest cultivators in the Limitless Land, Zhou Chi’s presence on the Ice Mountain Range made it a sacred land for cultivators who trained in ice techniques. There were countless experts going over to pay their respects to Zhou Chi, and many of them were Sons of Creation and old ancestors of their races. There were even several celestial emperors who would make a trip over, and there had been instances of half step Universe Gods going over too.  </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi’s prestige in the Limitless Land was incomparable! </p>
			<p> Even a prince of the Limitless Celestial Empire would have to show him some respect. </p>
			<p> By the time Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Ice Mountain Range, he saw hoards of experts from the various celestial empires going over to pay their respects to Zhou Chi. </p>
			<p> “Brother, are you also here to pay your respects to Lord Zhou?” An expert from the great families asked Huang Xiaolong when he saw the man traveling alone. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the person who approached him, and he realized that it was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended eleven elements to the perfection level. With his strength, his status wouldn’t be low in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> The expert became even more enthusiastic when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s reply. “I wonder what present you brought Lord Zhou Chi?” </p>
			<p> “Present?” </p>
			<p> “Brother, did you really not prepare anything?” The man asked when he noticed the confusion in Huang Xiaolong’s voice. “Everyone who wishes to meet Lord Zhou Chu would have to prepare presents! Moreover, they would need four sets of presents in order to gain an audience with him!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was surprised. “Four sets?” </p>
			<p> “One would be for Lord Zhou Chi, and the three other sets are for his disciples! Everyone who wishes to meet Lord Zhou Chi would have to register with his grand disciples. If you bring along a single set of present, you won’t even be able to step through the entrance of the mountain range!” The man explained. </p>
			<p> “There was a Son of Creation who prepared four ordinary sets of presents and he was thrown out by Lord Zhou Chi’s grand disciples!” </p>
			<p> There were some experts nearby who sighed, “There are too many people who wish to meet Lord Zhou Chi. Even Gods of Creation at the small competition and large completion stage might not be able to meet him!” </p>
			<p> “That sounds right. Lord Zhou Chi is someone who broke through the 10 billion units mark! Why would he meet with ordinary Gods of Creation?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned, “Since you know that you won’t be able to meet Lord Zhou Chi, why would you come all the way here?” </p>

			<p> “Many of us who came had a request for Lord Zhou Chi. Even if we can’t see him, getting close to his grand disciples is good enough. As long as they make a move, all your problems will go away.” </p>
			<p> “I wonder what you wish to ask of Lord Zhou Chi…” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Hesitating for a moment, the man eventually explained, “I am the old ancestor of the Wang Family in the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire. My family offended a prince of the royal family of the empire, and I wish to ask Lord Zhou Chi to plead on my behalf. Even if his grand disciples do it, the prince wouldn’t dare to do anything to my Wang Family!” </p>
			<p> There was an awkward expression when he spoke of his problem. </p>
			<p> “Standing Darkness Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong asked. “Isn’t that the celestial empire beside the Yin Yang Celestial Empire?” </p>
			<p> “Yes.” The expert nodded slightly. He had no idea why Huang Xiaolong would bring up the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “Alright, I know Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. I’ll get him to speak to the members of the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> “Lin Xian?! The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor?!” Wang Xin, the man who was speaking to Huang Xiaolong all this time, gasped. “Are you serious?!” </p>
			<p> The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. If he spoke on behalf of the Wang Family, there was no way anyone would dare to touch his family. After all, the old ancestor of the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire was only at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. 𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> However… </p>
			<p> The Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was like a god! Wang Xin didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could actually do as he said. After all, everyone knew that above the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor was Lin Qiankun himself, a half step Universe God! That was the most ancient half step Universe God in the Limitless Land they were talking about! </p>
			<p> Laughter came from the side before Wang Xin could say anything, and it was directed at Huang Xiaolong. “Brat, do you really expect us to believe you?!” It was a prince from one of the celestial empires. “I know Lord Zhou Chi, but he doesn’t know me!” </p>
			<p> Laughter filled the skies. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the person who spoke and sighed, “Are you from the Black Flame Celestial Empire?” </p>
			<p> “That’s right. I’m Hei Yu of the Black Flame Celestial Empire.”  </p>
			<p> The Black Flame Celestial Empire was comparable in strength to the Standing Darkness Celestial Empire, and their founders were at the same level of strength. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Alright. I’ll remember that.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he walked towards the peak of the Ice Mountain Range. </p>
			<p> Wang Xin stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. “Brother, you didn’t prepare any gifts! Don’t tell me you brought a message from the Yin Yang Celestial Emperor…” </p>
			<p> “Nope.” </p>
			<p> “Just go home… Without anything, you won’t be able to step through the gates of the Ice Mountain Range.” Wang Xin sighed. He was warning Huang Xiaolong out of goodwill. After all, there were many people who were sent rolling off the mountain when they turned up without any gifts. </p>
			<p> When that happened, their reputations would be dragged through the mud! They would turn into laughing stocks! </p>
			<p> When the prince of the Black Flame Celestial Empire noticed what was going on, he laughed loudly, “Things are going to get interesting now… There hasn’t been anyone who dared to enter the Ice Mountain Range without gifts in a long time. What do you think Wei Qi would do to him?” </p>
			<p> Wei Qi was Zhou Chi’s oldest disciple. He was in charge of guarding the entrance. </p>
			<p> “He’s definitely going to be kicked off the mountain. Hahaha! Lord Wei Qi will kick him so hard he rolls down the mountain!” Someone mocked as laughter filled the air.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3610 – Everywhere!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When Wang Xin noticed that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t taking his advice into account, he couldn’t help but shake his head. Perhaps, the man really knew Celestial Emperor Lin Xian, but even so, Wei Qi wasn’t going to care about that! </p>
			<p> In the past, there were many people who knew God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage who tried to ascend the mountain. They didn’t bring gifts with them, and neither did they bring a message from the expert in question. They were exactly like Huang Xiaolong and they were taught a lesson the moment they saw Wei Qi. </p>
			<p> When that happened, they tried to get the God of Creation Realm experts they knew to seek justice on their behalf, but how in the world would a God of Creation at the grand completion stage mess with Zhou Chi?! </p>
			<p> No one would offend a God of Creation Realm expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy for a nobody! </p>
			<p> As such, everyone who was sent rolling down the mountain could only suppress their anger. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the gazes around him and he continued to stroll towards the entrance. </p>
			<p> Read this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at the &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> He was stopped by the experts of the Ice Mountain the moment he approached. </p>
			<p> There weren’t too many experts stationed at the entrance, and there were probably sixty of them in total. All of them were experts who had comprehended at least eleven elements, and there were even some who had comprehended all thirteen elements!  </p>
			<p> All of them were obviously experts who chose to serve the Ice MOuntain. </p>
			<p> The person who stopped Huang Xiaolong wasn’t Wei Qi. Instead, it was some random expert who had comprehended twelve elements. Wei Qi was sitting comfortably on his throne in the middle of the plaza. </p>
			<p> A beauty brought a spiritual fruit to his lips as he sat there staring at the experts who wanted to enter the Ice Mountain. He was like an emperor who was staring down at his subjects! </p>
			<p> As soon as the man stopped Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t bother with the formalities. He stretched out his hand and snapped, “Where’s your present? Hand it over for me to take a look.” </p>
			<p> One wouldn’t be able to enter the mountain if they brought sub par gifts. Only presents that could rouse Wei Qi would allow one to enter the plaza. </p>
			<p> “I didn’t bring any.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Get Zhou Chi to come out here. I wish to meet him.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak loudly, but everyone managed to hear what he said. </p>
			<p> The expert who stopped him was stunned for a second and so was Wei Qi and the others. </p>
			<p> “You didn’t bring anything?! You want Lord Zhou Chi to come out here to meet you?!” The man stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> He felt that Huang Xiaolong was going overboard, but he didn’t dare to offend the man. Instead, he turned to look at Wei Qi. </p>
			<p> Wei Qi glanced at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye and he growled, “Who do you think you are?” </p>
			<p> “You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master. I know Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> “Blue Dragon Young Master? Lin Xian?!” Wei Qi roared with laughter the moment the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “I have never heard of you in my life! Lin Xian? Hahaha! Did all of you hear this?! Some random b*stard who claims to know Celestial Emperor Lin Xian dares to call my master out!” </p>
			<p> The beauty standing beside him giggled and everyone else burst into laughter. </p>
			<p> The lady placed a spiritual fruit into Wei Qi’s mouth delicately and sneered, “I thought he’s the Son of Creation from the Limitless Celestial Empire from the way he spoke… Who would have thought that he's just some random lowlife.” </p>
			<p> Glancing at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of her eye, she continued, “There hasn’t been anyone who dared to approach the entrance with no gifts… Lord Wei Qi, you’ll have to punish this man. Otherwise, our reputation will go down the drain!”  </p>
			<p> Wei Qi chuckled with glee, “Jiao’er, you’re amazing. You actually read my mind.” Turning to the man who stopped Huang Xiaolong, Wei Qi snorted, “Did we throw the last person who came here without gifts off the mountain? Alright, we’ll punish this little b*stard a little more. Break all his limbs and cripple his cultivation before throwing him off the mountain.” </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, the expert repealed a sinister smile when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “I believe you heard what Lord Wei Qi said.” </p>
			<p> “You can’t blame me for what’s about to come…” </p>
			<p> “You can only blame yourself for being stupid!” </p>
			<p> However, he discovered that he couldn’t even raise his hand after speaking. The space around him seemed to turn completely solid, and his body was like a solid block of wood. </p>
			<p> This… </p>
			<p> A look of confusion appeared on his face. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed as he looked at the expert standing before him. “You’re right. You can only blame yourself for what’s about to come.” </p>
			<p> Raising his hand slightly, the expert who comprehended twelve elements slowly turned into dust. From his head to his toe, he turned into specks of powder that drifted through the wind. </p>
			<p> Wei Qi wanted to say something when he noticed that the man wasn’t moving, but his eyes widened in shock when he saw the figure of the man crumbling. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Ice Mountain, along with those who came all this way to pay Zhou Chi a visit, were shocked! </p>
			<p> Leaping to his feet, Wei Qi roared, “You… How dare you kill a subordinate of my Ice Mountain?!” </p>
			<p> That was the first time anything of the kind happened. 𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> No one dared to kill experts who served the Ice Mountain. </p>
			<p> “I’ll give you one last chance. Call Zhou Chi out. Otherwise, you’ll suffer the same fate as him.” Huang Xiaolong muttered indifferently. </p>
			<p> Roaring in rage, Wei Qi released his aura completely.  </p>
			<p> “Half step God of Creation!” Those standing around gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> It was true that Wei Qi had reached the doors of the God of Creation Realm. He was even stronger than Ying Wuyou! </p>
			<p> “Do you really think you can kill me?!” Wei Qi screamed, “Not even Lin Xian would dare to say something like this in front of my face! Even if a God of Creation at the grand completion stage arrives, he wouldn’t dare to touch a single hair on my head! You can try it if you have the guts to!” </p>
			<p> “If you dare to lay a finger on me, you won’t be leaving this place alive!” </p>
			<p> A mocking sneer could be seen in Wei Qi’s eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong casually pressed downwards with his palm. Wei Qi felt as though the entire universe was crashing down on him. </p>
			<p> It was something he had never felt in his life! </p>
			<p> Before he could react, he was sent straight into the depths of the mountain range! </p>
			<p> Wei Qi, who had unleashed all his strength just a moment ago, was flattened like a pancake! </p>
			<p> “I don’t have a habit of touching a single hair on your head. What are you going to do now that I touched every single hair on your body?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3611 – Ten Strongest Experts in the Limitless Land&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong’s words would never register in Wei Qi’s mind. After all, the man couldn’t be more dead. </p>
			<p> The beauty who served Wei Qi a moment ago stared at Huang Xiaolong with a pale face. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Ice Mountain felt an explosion going off in their minds when they saw what Huang Xiaolong did. </p>
			<p> Wei Qi was the son of Zhou Chi’s eldest disciple, and he was the only son at that! He was showered with lots of love even from the other disciples of Zhou Chi and everyone could only imagine the rage everyone would fly into when his death was discovered. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi was a God of Creation who had accumulated 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy! His rage could cause the Limitless Land to tremble and entire regions to quake. </p>
			<p> When Wang Xin saw how Huang Xiaolong killed Wei Qi, he was stunned. In several breaths of time, the man who was speaking to him went ahead and killed Zhou Chi’s grand disciple! </p>
			<p> Hei Yu, the prince of the Black Flame Celestial Empire, was equally speechless. </p>
			<p> A group of experts flew towards the Ice Mountain as everything played out and it was evident that they were there to request an audience with Zhou Chi. The person in the lead was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, we just received news that someone killed Zhou Chi’s grand disciple, Wei Qi, at the entrance of the mountain.” One of the experts flying behind him relayed the news.  </p>
			<p> “What?” The God of Creation frowned and gasped in shock. </p>
			<p> “Who grew the b*lls to kill Wei Qi?!” </p>
			<p> “I heard that it was someone who called himself the Blue Dragon Young Master… Apparently, he knows Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire.” The subordinate explained. </p>
			<p> “Blue Dragon Young Master?” </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun and the others practically sealed the news the moment the battle ended in the Yin Yang City, and no one knew what happened during the exchange between Huang Xiaolong and Ying Ze. As such, no one had any news on the Blue Dragon Young Master. </p>
			<p> “Let’s hurry…” The God of Creation increased his speed once again after a moment of thought. </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Your Majesty, this is a good thing! If Lord Zhou Chi decides to make things difficult for the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, our Glorious Celestial Empire would be able to gain a lot of benefits!” The subordinate continued. </p>
			<p> The Glorious Celestial Empire had some beef with the Yin Yang Celestial Empire since a long time ago, and if Zhou Chi chooses to mess with Lin Qiankun because of the Blue Dragon Young Master’s act of killing Wei Qi, they would gain a ton of benefits! </p>
			<p> The God of Creation in the lead was Celestial Emperor Rong Ying of the Glorious Celestial Empire, and his strength was comparable to Lin Xian. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying chuckled, “You’re right. Let’s hope that this whatever dragon young master kills several more people from the Ice Mountain. When Zhou Chi rages, the Yin Yang Celestial Empire will definitely be dragged into this.” </p>
			<p> The experts behind him roared with laughter. 𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝓷𝓸𝙫𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for their party to arrive. When they stood in the air above the plaza, they saw Wei Qi’s corpse deep in the ground. </p>
			<p> “Is that the Blue Dragon Young Master?” Rong Ying looked at Huang Xiaolong and muttered. He frowned as he couldn’t sense Huang Xiaolong’s aura. </p>
			<p> Several dozen figures emerged from the peak of the mountain as they charged towards the plaza as soon as Rong Ying and the others arrived. </p>
			<p> “That’s Wei Chong!” </p>
			<p> Wei Chong was Zhou Chi’s oldest disciple, and he was the strongest among all three disciples! He was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he was close to the half step Universe God Realm. </p>
			<p> “”Wei Chong’s aura is terrifying! I’m afraid he’s about to enter the gates of the half step Universe God Realm…” An expert behind Rong Ying sighed. </p>
			<p> The man was one of the old ancestors of a super family in the celestial empire, and he was God of Creation at the large completion stage. </p>
			<p> “Wei Chong is one of the strongest God of Creation at the grand completion stage in the Limitless Land! He definitely deserves the title…” Rong Ying muttered, “He challenged Lord Zhang Guoteng in the past and they fought to a draw.” </p>
			<p> Zhang Guoteng was a half step Universe God, but Wei Chong managed to fight him to a draw! </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Wang Xin, Hei Yu, and everyone else who stood at the entrance were forced to their knees when Wei Chong’s aura surrounded them. </p>
			<p> Under their frightened gaze, Wei Chong appeared in the plaza where Wei Qi was killed. </p>
			<p> Wei Chong wasn’t the only one who came. Zhou Chi’s second disciple, Zhao Mang, and his third disciple, Lu Shenglin, were there too. There were sixteen of them who arrived, and twelve of them were Gods of Creation. </p>
			<p> Their expression turned dark when they saw Wei Qi’s corpse. </p>
			<p> The air around the mountain seemed to turn solid as they turned their gazes to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “You killed my son! You killed my only son!” Wei Chong growled. </p>
			<p> Everyone heard the killing intent deep in his voice. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with him and he casually sighed, “You’re not my opponent. I’ll give you a piece of advice. Call Zhou Chi out here.” </p>
			<p> Their eyes widened in shock. </p>
			<p> “Who the h*ll is this guy?! He dares to claim that Wei Chong isn’t his opponent!” One of the God of Creation Realm experts behind Rong Ying gasped. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying was equally as surprised. </p>
			<p> With anger filling his heart, Wei Chong glared at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> However, Zhao Mang was the first to roar, “Brat, you’re not qualified to see my master! Senior Brother, I’ll kill him on your behalf!” </p>
			<p> “No.” Wei Chong stopped Zhao Mang and growled, “I’ll kill him myself.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he started to walk towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He hadn’t fought seriously since his last battle with Zhang Guoteng. He had been comprehending the mysteries of the universe all this while, and his strength reached a whole new level. He felt that even if Huang Xiaolong was a half step Universe God, he would win all the same. </p>
			<p> A pair of twin blades appeared in Wei Chong’s hand as he charged towards Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Before he could actually attack, a voice boomed through the air. “Wei Chong, fall back.” </p>
			<p> The voice was a little hoarse and a white haired old man appeared before their eyes before anyone could react. No one other than Huang Xiaolong knew how he appeared before them. </p>
			<p> “Master!” Wei Chong and the others bowed hastily when they saw Zhou Chi standing in front of them. </p>
			<p> Celestial Emperor Rong Ying and the others either bowed or got to their knees, and those who were of lower status prostrated themselves on the ground. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi, one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land, had arrived! </p>
			<p> He had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and not even Chen Huanzhi, the grand marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire would dare to slight the man. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi’s hair might be white, but his back was ramrod straight as he stood between Huang Xiaolong and his disciples. His eyes sparkled like stars as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Is there a reason you came all the way here?” </p>
			<p> Even at his level, he failed to see through Huang Xiaolong’s strength. There was only a sneaking suspicion in his heart that told him that he wouldn’t be able to defeat the youngster before him. </p>
			<p> “I heard that you have a lot of universe-level spiritual veins…” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> With his expression drooping slightly, Zhou Chi narrowed his eyes, “Are you here to steal my treasury?!”</p>

			</title>
			<p> Wei Chong and the others flew into a rage when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Lu Shenglin screamed, “Are you f*cking blind, you dumb*ss?! How dare you set your sights on our treasury?!” </p>
			<p> “Master, you can’t allow this bandit to leave!” Wei Chong glared at Huang Xiaolong and he couldn’t wait to chop the man into a billion pieces. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying and the others were surprised when they learned of Huang Xiaolong’s intentions. 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑏𝓃ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝒸ℴ𝘮</p>
			<p> Raising his hand slightly, Zhou Chi stopped his disciples from doing anything rash. </p>
			<p> Staring at Zhou Chi, Huang Xiaolong spoke slowly, “I want every single universe-level spiritual vein you have.” Initially, he planned to trade a top-grade creation artifact for the treasures. However, since they were hell bent on painting him as a bandit, he didn’t mind becoming one. </p>
			<p> A cold light flashed through Zhou Chi’s eyes and he growled, “You can make your move…” </p>
			<p> Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “You can make the first move. Otherwise, you won’t be able to show off your strength before you’re defeated.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong proclaimed Zhou Chi’s defeat before the battle began. That caused rage to fill Zhou Chi’s heart and he snorted in anger, “Alright, let’s see how capable you are!”  </p>
			<p> Circulating his grand cosmos energy, Zhou Chi released all 13 billion units. To be exact, he used all 13.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy he accumulated. </p>
			<p> Under the pressure of his terrifyingly strong aura, the entire mountain started to shake. Cracks formed in the ground, and Rong Ying and the others stared at the trembling permafrost on the top of the mountain. </p>
			<p> The heavens trembled under his might! </p>
			<p> The wind started to howl as the void became unsteady. </p>
			<p> Moreover, that was only what happened when Zhou Chi released his aura! </p>
			<p> Retreating with haste, Rong Ying and the others knew that they didn’t have the ability to get caught up in a battle among experts of Zhou Chi’s level. </p>
			<p> Even Wei Chong and the other disciples escaped. </p>
			<p> When experts at Zhou Chi’s level battled, even the shockwaves could seriously injure God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage. </p>
			<p> A staff made of ice appeared in Zhou Chi’s hand as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> A ray of light emerged from the staff and the temperature in the surroundings dropped significantly. Rong Ying and the others felt like their dao souls were about to be completely frozen. </p>
			<p> The ice staff looked unassuming, but it was a top-grade creation artifact. In fact, it was close to a universe treasure! </p>
			<p> A universe treasure was born in the universes, and there were thirteen of them in total! No one could refine a universe treasure unless they became a Universe God. Even so, there were several supreme overlords who could create treasures that were pseudo universe treasures. Even though the power of pseudo universe treasures weren’t as strong as universe treasure, it was much stronger than top-grade creation artifacts. </p>
			<p> The ice staff in Zhou Chi’s hand had reached that level. </p>
			<p> With his grand cosmos energy pouring into the staff, rays of light emerged from the staff and it shot straight towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too bothered with the strike and he casually raised his hand to stop it. Ice started forming around his arms and it slowly formed around his entire body. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, he turned into an ice statue. </p>
			<p> The layer of frost became thicker and thicker such that no one could see Huang Xiaolong’s figure. Looking at him from afar, everyone would only see a solid block of ice. </p>
			<p> Wei Chong and the others rejoiced when they saw what happened. </p>
			<p> They knew how powerful their master was, and even half step Universe Gods wouldn’t be able to free themselves if they were sealed up by their master. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Zhou Chi lowered the staff in his hand. </p>
			<p> “Congratulations, Master!” Wei Chong and the others laughed as they approached Zhou Chi. </p>
			<p> A smile appeared on Zhou Chi’s face when he heard his disciples. </p>
			<p> When they looked at the giant ice block before them, Zhao Mang sneered, “I thought he was strong when he dared to call master out. What a dumb*ss! Even senior brother would be able to deal with him without breaking a sweat!” </p>
			<p> “He’s a weakling who can only run his mouth! What a loser! It’s a pity that there’s a lot of people like him in the Limitless Land.” Wei Chong snorted, “We’ll deal with him properly in honor of Qi’er!” </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi nodded slightly. “We’ll hang him at the entrance and slice off parts of his dao heart a piece at a time!” The ice staff in his hand trembled and he declared, “I’ll seal off his grand cosmos energy right now!” </p>
			<p> A ray of light entered the ice block in an instant. </p>
			<p> In the distance, Rong Ying’s subordinate chuckled, “Your Majesty, that brat failed to take on a single attack from Lord Zhou Chi! He really over estimated himself this time! What a joke!” </p>
			<p> “Not even ordinary half step Universe Gods would be able to stop Lord Zhou Chi’s frost origin qi! It doesn’t surprise me that the youngster is defeated.” Rong Ying shook his head. “I’m shocked by the fact that he couldn’t even take a single strike. </p>
			<p> He was definitely disappointed in his heart. </p>
			<p> However, the block of ice trembled slightly before their very eyes. </p>
			<p> Everyone was shocked. </p>
			<p> Soon after, the trembling became more intense as cracks started to form on its surface. Gasping slightly, Zhou Chi released his frost origin qi again in an attempt to seal Huang Xiaolong. It was completely useless as the cracks became even larger. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on FreeWebNovel.com.  </p>
			<p> A ray of golden light tore through the skies all of a sudden and a terrifying wave of power filled the air. </p>
			<p> Not even Zhou Chi could withstand the blast as he was sent flying through the air. Everyone from the Ice Mountain was sent smashing into the mountain range. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying, Wang Xin, and the others were thrown god knew how many miles away. </p>
			<p> When they finally found their footing, the ice block was nowhere to be seen as Huang Xiaolong’s figure could be seen in mid alr. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi’s eyes widened in shock and he gasped, “How could you…” </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that you could seal me with your pitiful strength?” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I didn’t stop your attack because I wanted to see how strong you were.” </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong no longer wanted to waste his time and he appeared before Zhou Chi with a single step. </p>
			<p> Frowning in shock, Zhou Chi wanted to defend himself with his ice staff but it was useless. Huang Xiaolong grabbed the staff with his left hand before plunging his right claw through Zhou Chi’s chest. </p>
			<p> The top-grade creation artifact armor around Zhou Chi’s chest was burned to ashes with the flame surrounding Huang Xiaolong’s arm.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3613 – Zhou Chi Surrenders&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Celestial Emperor Rong Ying and the others stared on in shock as Huang Xiaolong’s hand pierced through Zhou Chi’s body. </p>
			<p> When he smashed into the mountain below, there were fiery red holes in his chest. Smoke emerged from them as Rong Ying and the others gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> As a peerless expert who had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy, Zhou Chi’s physical body was unbelievably strong. Even so, Huang Xiaolong pierced a hole through it along with his armor! </p>
			<p> They could imagine how strong Huang Xiaolong’s flame was! </p>
			<p> “That…” Zhou Chi crawled to his feet and stared at Huang Xiaolong with fear in his eyes. His calm appearance was nowhere to be seen as dust decorated his once spotless beard. </p>
			<p> “That’s one of the four Universe Origin Fires…” Huang Xiaolong admitted. </p>
			<p> There was no way ordinary flames could burn a hole through top-grade creation artifacts. </p>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t use all four origin fires when he attacked. He only used the White Tiger Origin Fire to defeat Zhou Chi. </p>
			<p> When Zhou Chi heard Huang Xiaolong’s revelation, his body trembled like a leaf in the wind. The same happened to Wei Chong, Zhao Mang, and the others. 𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝒃𝒏𝓸𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝙢 </p>
			<p> “Four Universe Origin Fires!” </p>
			<p> Universe treasure! </p>
			<p> One of the thirteen universe treasures was in the hands of the Blue Dragon Young Master! </p>
			<p> Under their frightened gaze, three other balls of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. The light they emitted swallowed the land and even the space started to tremble around Huang Xiaolong. The entire mountain started to quake violently. </p>
			<p> Under the might of the four universe origin fires, Zhou Chi and the others felt as though their dao souls were burning up. </p>
			<p> However, the look in their eyes started to change as greed filled their hearts. That was a universe treasure! No one could remain calm when seeing a treasure as rare as that. </p>
			<p> Seeing the heated gaze in their eyes, Huang Xiaolong casually dragged Zhou Chi over to himself. </p>
			<p> Like an eagle grabbing at a little chick, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Zhou Chi by the neck. </p>
			<p> When Wei Chong, Zhao Mang, Lu Shenglin, Rong Ying, and the others saw how helpless Zhou Chi was, the look of greed in their eyes vanished. That was a God of Creation who had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy! He was one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land! Even so, he couldn’t so much as struggle in front of Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> A look of fear flashed through Zhou Chi’s eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Supreme Overlord?! </p>
			<p> The same thought flashed through the eyes of everyone present. </p>
			<p> “I came here wanting to trade a top-grade creation artifact for your universe-level spiritual veins…” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You forced me to change my mind…” </p>
			<p> Regret filled their hearts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was speaking, Rong Ying and the experts of the Glorious Celestial Empire tried to back away quietly. When they arrived at the edge of the Ice Mountain Range, countless rays of starlight emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. </p>
			<p> It formed a barrier around the entire mountain range as it stopped Rong Ying and the others from escaping. </p>
			<p> Gasping in fright, the members of the Glorious Celestial Empire stared at the barrier of light in shock. They discovered that the rays of starlight that emerged had transformed into giant branches! </p>
			<p> Silvery light enveloped the branches and it looked incomparably majestic. </p>
			<p> In a state of panic, one of the Gods of Creation in the large completion stage slashed at the branch with his creation artifact. With a giant blast, he was sent flying from the backlash. Despite his strength, the branch wasn’t scratched in the slightest. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying’s expression sank immediately as the experts of the Ice Mountain fell into despair.  </p>
			<p> “This?! Star Dragon Divine Tree?!” Zhou Chi roared in shock and his eyes widened in disbelief. </p>
			<p> Star Dragon Divine Tree! </p>
			<p> Another universe treasure! The Star Dragon Divine Tree ranked number second among all the universe treasures, and it was only second to the Universe Boat! </p>
			<p> Wei Chong and the others felt the world crumbling around them. </p>
			<p> Peak-level experts would drown the universe in blood in order to obtain a single universe treasure! Not a single person in existence could resist the temptation of obtaining a universe treasure and getting a single one was near impossible! However, the Blue Dragon Young Master standing before them had two of them! </p>
			<p> “That’s right. This is the Star Dragon Divine Tree.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he released the Star Dragon Divine Tree completely. Countless roots emerged from the void and covered the mountain range. The Ice Mountain Range became completely sealed off. </p>
			<p> In the space constrained by the Star Dragon Divine Tree, pretty specks of light danced about like little fairies. With the frosty qi from the Ice Mountain Range, a picturesque scene like no other was formed, but no one in there was in the mood to enjoy the sights. The frosty qi that once filled the Ice Mountain Range seemed to seep deep into their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Sen… Senior, we are from the Glorious Celestial Empire and we have nothing to do with the experts from the Ice Mountain.” Rong Ying started to panic. “We’re passing through the area and we mean no disrespect. Please let us go and we will swear an oath never to reveal anything that happened here.” </p>
			<p> “Relax. As long as all of you submit to me, I won’t kill anyone.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> Rong Ying’s expression changed. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Before anyone could react, someone slammed their head into the ground in a great kowtow and yelled, “The Yan Family of the Black Flame Celestial Empire is willing to submit to Lord Blue Dragon! We’ll listen to your every command!” </p>
			<p> It went without saying that the only person who could represent the family was the old ancestor, and the old ancestor of the Yan Family could be seen prostrated on the ground. </p>
			<p> The members of the Yan Family got to their knees in unison. </p>
			<p> When that happened, Hei Yu’s expression was ugly beyond comparison. </p>
			<p> The Yan Family was the second strongest family in the Black Flame Celestial Empire and they had always been loyal to the celestial empire. Now, they were the first to submit to Huang Xiaolong! Didn’t that mean that the entire Yan Family had betrayed the Black Flame Celestial Empire?! </p>
			<p> After the Yan Family, many other families chose to submit. </p>
			<p> The members of the Glorious Celestial Empire felt their countenance turning darker and darker as more people got to their knees. </p>
			<p> Of course, the members of the Ice Mountain remained on their feet. </p>
			<p> “To protect my secret of the four Universe Origin Fires and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, I’ll kill everyone who refuses to submit in one minute.”  </p>
			<p> The experts who were hesitating quickly fell to their knees and Hei Yu was part of that group. In the end, the only ones left standing were the members of the Glorious Celestial Empire and the Ice Mountain. </p>
			<p> “If I lead the members of the Ice Mountain to surrender, can you promise not to kill any one of us?” Zhou Chi spoke all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Everyone felt their bodies trembling when they heard his voice. </p>
			<p> “Master, you…” Wei Chong, Zhao Mang, and Lu Shenglin yelled in unison. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi ignored them all and looked at Huang Xiaolong silently. </p>
			<p> “Of course.” At his level, there was no need to lie to Zhou Chi. </p>
			<p> “Alright. On behalf of my Ice Mountain, I will make the decision to surrender to Lord Blue Dragon! All of you will do the same!” Zhou Chi’s voice filled the skies. </p>
			<p> Releasing Zhou Chi, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that the man would try anything funny. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong loosened his grip, Zhou Chi didn’t choose to run. He bowed respectfully before ordering Wei Chong and the others to get to their knees. </p>
			<p> The only group left were those from the Glorious Celestial Empire.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3614 – Jian Wushuang’s Granddaughter&lt;/h4&gt; 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘣𝘯𝑜𝓋𝘦𝑙.𝒸𝑜𝓂</p>
			</title>
			<p> The experts of the Ice Mountain stared at the members of the Glorious Celestial Empire. Zhou Chi locked his aura onto Celestial Empire Rong Ying. </p>
			<p> Finding it hard to breathe, Rong Ying knew that there was no way he could talk himself out of this. </p>
			<p> “I… I am willing to submit.” Eventually, Rong Ying sighed and fell to his knees like everyone else. </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Originally, he was there to look for Zhou Chi on behalf of his father. Well, they met the man, but the situation was nothing like what he expected. </p>
			<p> When the experts of the Glorious Celestial Empire saw their celestial emperor on his knees, none of them dared to hesitate. They quickly chose to submit. </p>
			<p> Getting Zhou Chi, Wei Chong, Zhao Mang, Lu Shenglin, Rong Ying, and the other Gods of Creation to release their defenses on their dao soul, Huang Xiaolong branded them all. </p>
			<p> Like before, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remove the Limitless Master’s restrictions on their dao souls. He merely covered it up with his own. </p>
			<p> Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother personally controlling those who weren’t in the God of Creation Realm. He sent Zhou Chi and the others to do the dirty work for him.  </p>
			<p> After surrendering, Zhou Chi obediently handed over the treasury of the Ice Mountain over to Huang Xiaolong. Rong Ying and the others naturally had to take out everything they had. </p>
			<p> As one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land, Zhou Chi received many gifts when he went out to deal with other people’s problems. The number of universe-level spiritual veins he had exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s expectations. </p>
			<p> There were sixty-one spiritual veins in total! </p>
			<p> Even though there were many low-grade spiritual veins, there were more than thirty high-grade spiritual veins. Out of the sixty-one spiritual veins, there were five top-grade universe-level spiritual veins! </p>
			<p> Next came Rong Ying. Even though he didn’t bring too many universe-level spiritual veins with him on his trip, he had a single strand of high-level universe-level spiritual vein. It was his gift to Zhou Chi in order to request for his assistance. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t ask Rong Ying about the problem. Instead, he directly ordered Zhou Chi to deal with it. </p>
			<p> There was no way he would deal with Rong Ying’s problem personally when Zhou Chi was enough. He entered seclusion immediately in Zhou Chi’s grand palace. </p>
			<p> Sitting on the eye of the first layer of formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong threw every single universe-level spiritual vein into the formation. He started to cultivate once the universe source qi started to emerge. </p>
			<p> By the time he was done, several hundred thousand years had passed. </p>
			<p> His cultivation was much more effective than his previous session in the Yin Yang City. He managed to clear out a lot of the hidden impurities in his body and the grand cosmos energy in all three worlds transformed quite a bit. </p>
			<p> When he emerged from Zhou Chi’s palace, he felt much lighter than before. He broke through to the 18.9 billion units mark and he was close to reaching the next level of strength. </p>
			<p> Summoning Zhou Chi the moment he emerged, he asked about the matter regarding the Glorious Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “It’s nothing much. I dealt with it.” Zhou Chi replied respectfully. </p>
			<p> It might be easy for Zhou Chi to deal with the matter, but it might be something that the Glorious Celestial Empire couldn’t do no matter how hard they tried! </p>
			<p> Rong Hua, the old ancestor of the Glorious Celestial Empire, was a half step Universe God. He was as strong as Ying Ze and a problem he couldn’t solve had to be a huge one. </p>
			<p> “Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire have arrived. They wish to meet you…” Zhou Chi reported. “They arrived soon after you entered seclusion, and they remained here ever since.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Could something have happened? Why else would they wait for him to emerge from seclusion? </p>
			<p> “Send them in.” </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for them to arrive. However, there was someone else with them, Tao Hang. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?” </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian started to hesitate. </p>
			<p> Tao Hang was the first to speak. “Lord, it’s related to Tao Han’er.” </p>
			<p> “Did something happen to her?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> “Yes… Not long after you left for the Ice Mountain, Han’er went out to cultivate on her own. She disappeared soon after. </p>
			<p> The frown on Huang Xiaolong’s face deepened. He turned to Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian. “How did she disappear?” </p>
			<p> “When we learned of her disappearance, we sent everyone we could mobilize to look for her. As it turned out, she was brought away by a group of people!” Lin Qiankun replied. </p>
			<p> “Who was it?!” Huang Xiaolong’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> “They were experts from the Jian Family in the Zhu Lan Lands…” Lin Qiankun replied. </p>
			<p> “Jian Family?!” Zhou Chi yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> The master of the Zhu Lan Lands was Zhu Chen, Zhu Qiming’s father. </p>
			<p> The Jian Family in the Zhu Lan Lands was only second to the Zhu Family, and they were a hegemon in the Unknown Lands. The old ancestor of the Jian Family might not be a Supreme Overlord at the level of Zhu Chen and the others, but he was barely weaker than them! </p>
			<p> If Huang Xiaolong were to compare him to the Limitless Master, the old ancestor of the Jian Family would be able to trash the Limitless Master even with the help of the Limitless Grand Formation. </p>
			<p> In the Unknown Space, the old ancestor of the Jian Family was the strongest cultivator in the way of the sword! </p>
			<p> “Why did they take her away?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> With their identity, there was no way the Jian Family would send their men over to kidnap Tao Han. </p>
			<p> “According to them, Han’er is Jian Wushuang’s granddaughter!” Lin Qiankun hesitated before speaking. </p>
			<p> That was the intelligence he managed to obtain after a ton of investigation. </p>
			<p> As the matter concerned the Jian Family, Lin Qiankun had to personally carry out the investigation. With Zhu Chen’s identity as a Supreme Overlord and the Jian Family’s reputation in the Zhu Lan Lands, no one else had the guts or ability to look into the matter.  </p>
			<p> “What?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped. </p>
			<p> Jian Wushuang was the old ancestor of the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> “Yes… According to something that happened in the past, they lost Han’er in the Limitless Land.” Lin Xian explained. “All these years, the Jian Family has been trying to look for her.” </p>
			<p> One could imagine the shock Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian felt when they learned of Tao Han’er’s identity. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong fell silent for a moment. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun and the others didn’t dare to say a word. </p>
			<p> “All of you can leave if there’s nothing else.” Huang Xiaolong muttered eventually. </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, Lin Qiankun and the others returned to the Yin Yang City. </p>
			<p> Nothing else happened that night and Huang Xiaolong left the Ice Mountain with Zhou Chi leading the way. They left for the Glorious Celestial Empire.. </p>
			<p> The reason he went there was to subdue Rong Hua. Rong Ying told Huang Xiaolong that his father was in possession of a ton of universe-level spiritual veins.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3615 – Twin Dragons of the Limitless Land&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> As the Glorious Celestial Empire wasn’t located too far away from the Ice Mountain, they managed to arrive in less than ten days. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi’s arrival naturally alerted Rong Hua. </p>
			<p> When he came out of his palace to personally greet Zhou Chi, he was shocked to discover the presence of a black-haired youngster. Zhou Chi was acting so respectfully that Rong Hua had no idea how to react. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhou Chi, he…” Rong Hua couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> “This is my lord.” Zhou Chi introduced. </p>
			<p> “Lord, this…” Rong Hua was shocked and he looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. </p>
			<p> The meaning behind Zhou Chi’s words weren’t as simple as they seemed. </p>
			<p> When he went to the Ice Mountain in the past, he noticed that the subordinates who had submitted under Zhou Chi’s banner addressed him the same way. Now, Zhou Chi, one of the ten strongest experts of the Limitless Land with more than 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy was addressing the young man the same way! </p>
			<p> “I am the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he noticed Rong Hua’s shock. “You didn’t hear wrong, Zhou Chi is now my subordinate.”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong no longer planned to hide the fact. </p>
			<p> When Rong Hua heard Huang Xiaolong making the admission, his jaws dropped. </p>
			<p> “In fact, your son has also submitted to me.” Huang Xiaolong added. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Rong Hua exclaimed in shock. </p>
			<p> “Zhou Chi isn’t the only one who serves me. Lin Qiankun, Chen Huanzhi, Lin Xian…” Huang Xiaolong listed out more than a dozen God of Creation Realm experts in one go. </p>
			<p> Well, Rong Hua didn’t care much about most of them, but Rong Hua felt his heart pounding when he heard that Lin Qiankun was one of Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates. </p>
			<p> Even though Chen Huanzhi wasn’t as strong as Zhou Chi, he was a grand marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire! If he submitted to Huang Xiaolong, that would mean that he had betrayed the Limitless Master! </p>
			<p> Half a day later… </p>
			<p> Rong Hua was no exception as he eventually kneeled to pledge his allegiance to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He didn’t have a choice in the matter. After all, Huang Xiaolong was too damn strong. He was more than capable of forcing Rong Hua into submission with the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> After Rong Hua submitted, he handed over every single universe-level spiritual vein in the Glorious Treasury. Even though it wasn’t comparable to the treasury of the Ice Mountain, there were more than twenty spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion after receiving the goods. </p>
			<p> Now, the most important thing he had to do was to break through the 20 billion units mark! </p>
			<p> As such, he needed as much universe spiritual qi as he could obtain! He also needed to purify the hidden dangers in his body as quickly as possible. </p>
			<p> After cultivating for such a long time in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong discovered the importance of clearing the hidden danger in his body. The longer they remained, the worse it would be for him. 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p> Several tens of thousands of years later… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong emerged from seclusion. </p>
			<p> He finally broke through the 19 billion units mark and was closing in on the 19.1 billion mark. </p>
			<p> Now, he had nearly a billion more grand cosmos energy that the Limitless Master. In the Limitless Land, Huang Xiaolong was unbeatable! </p>
			<p> He stood above the grand palace of the Glorious Celestial Empire and he stared into the skies above. </p>
			<p> The sun was setting and a beautiful picture was painted.  </p>
			<p> “Lord…” Zhou Chi and Rong Hua stood behind Huang Xiaolong respectfully. </p>
			<p> “Make your arrangements.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “We’re going to the Limitless City in a few days.” </p>
			<p> Limitless City! </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi and Rong Hua were stunned to learn of his intentions. </p>
			<p> To an expert in the Limitless Land, the Limitless City was the true holy land of cultivation. Even Zhou Chi and Rong Hua respected the Limitless City deep down in their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Inform Lin Qiankun to head over with us.” Huang Xiaolong said after thinking about it for a moment. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi and Rong Hua bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> Several days later, Huang Xiaolong, Zhou Chi. and Rong Hua left the Glorious Celestial Empire for the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. Lin Qiankun had been waiting for some time when they arrived, and they left for the Limitless City the moment Huang Xiaolong’s party arrived. They got on the Blue Dragon Flying Ship and the group made their way over. </p>
			<p> “It seems like it’s time to refine the Blue Dragon Flying Ship again…” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. </p>
			<p> Even though the Blue Dragon Flying Ship has already surpassed many top-grade creation artifacts, it was still far from a pseudo universe treasure. </p>
			<p> Nothing happened along the way. </p>
			<p> The four of them finally arrived after one whole year. </p>
			<p> The Limitless Land was extremely large. Even an ordinary God of Creation Realm expert at the large completion stage would need several dozen years to arrive in the Limitless Celestial Empire. They were only able to arrive so quickly due to the speed of the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. </p>
			<p> “The Limitless City is really a good place to cultivate…” Huang Xiaolong looked at the massive city before him and sighed. Zhou Chi, Rong Hua, and Lin Qiankun stood silently behind him. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi replied, “Lord is right. In the past, the Limitless Master chose to build the city here because of the origin qi...” </p>
			<p> The origin qi he referred to was the source qi produced by the universe. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly. </p>
			<p> There were tons of people who were entering the Limitless City and Huang Xiaolong’s group didn’t stand out. Their gazes might linger on the four for a second longer, but no one gave them a second thought. Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua were half step Universe Gods and they rarely appeared in public. There weren’t many people who could recognize them. </p>
			<p> When they were admiring the sights, a commotion broke out in the distance. A weirdly armored troop riding on sea dragons headed straight for the city. There were several tens of thousands of them! </p>
			<p> “It’s the Ocean Race from the Sleepless Sea!” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. </p>
			<p> There were several experts who started discussing with each other in the distance. “I heard that the Sleepless Sea is trying to patch up the relations with our Limitless Celestial Empire. The crown prince of the Sleepless Sea came on the orders of the king in order to negotiate with our Human Race.  </p>
			<p> “The crown prince of the Sleepless Sea actually came! I heard that he’s the most talented expert in the third generation of the Sleepless Sea. He entered the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm a long time ago and I wonder if he broke through to the grand completion stage…” </p>
			<p> “Alongside His Highness, Wu Qifeng, they’re known as the twin dragons of our Limitless Land!” </p>
			<p> Their discussions entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears. </p>
			<p> As they continued to talk among themselves, the giant army arrived before the city gates. Another impressive army rode out of the city to welcome them and they were personally led by the Limitless Crown Prince, Wu Qifeng! </p>
			<p> “Brother Ye Jing, it’s been a long time! Have you been well?” Wu Qifeng cupped his fists and a brilliant smile hung on his lips. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Ye Jing chuckled and started to exchange pleasantries with Wu Qifeng. </p>
			<p> “My father has already prepared a banquet for all of you! Brother Ye Jing, please!” Wu Qifeng invited Ye Jing into the city after a short chat. </p>
			<p> “Please.” Ye Jing didn’t reject the gesture of goodwill and they prepared to enter the city. </p>
			<p> However, they stopped dead in their tracks when Wu Qifeng noticed Huang Xiaolong’s group from the corner of his eye. His gaze landed on Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3616 – Qi Wufeng’s Bow&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, Wu Qifeng left Ye Jingyu’s side and he made his way over to Huang Xiaolong’s group. 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝓂</p>
			<p> “What’s wrong with the crown prince?!” </p>
			<p> “Who in the world are they?! Does His Highness recognize them?” </p>
			<p> Several old ancestors of great families in the Limitless City exclaimed. </p>
			<p> “Your… Your Highness!” Several experts called out to him. </p>
			<p> However, he ignored them all and he flew directly to Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua. </p>
			<p> “Qifeng greets Senior Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua!” He bowed respectfully after speaking. </p>
			<p> Those standing around felt the world spinning around them. </p>
			<p> Senior?!  </p>
			<p> Who in the world was Wu Qifeng?! He was the crown prince of the Limitless Celestial Empire and he was a God of Creation who might be at the grand completion stage! The number of people who could get him to bow could be counted on one hand, but three of them appeared at once! </p>
			<p> Ye Jingyu and the experts of the Sleepless Sea were equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> “Zhou Chi?! Lin Qiankun?! Rong Hua?!” Ye Jingyu gasped. </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun and Rong Hua didn’t dare to act all high and mighty when they saw Wu Qifeng bowing to them. A smile appeared on their face and they nodded slightly, “Your Highness.” </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi was the only one who nodded slightly without saying a word. After all, not even the Limitless Celestial Emperor would put on airs around him. As such, there was no need for him to fawn over Wu Qifeng. </p>
			<p> With his gaze turning slowly towards Huang Xiaolong, he asked, “This is…” </p>
			<p> Everyone could see how respectful the three of them were behaving towards him. </p>
			<p> However, the three of them refused to say a word. </p>
			<p> Wu Qifeng felt his heart palpitating when he thought of a shocking possibility. </p>
			<p> “You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” </p>
			<p> Forcing a smile, Wu Qifeng stuttered, “So it’s Lord Blue Dragon…” He turned to the three of them and explained, “If my father knew that seniors have come, he’ll be more than happy to play host to you. Please allow me to invite you over to the palace.” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong interrupted him, “We have something to deal with now that we’re here. We won’t be going to your palace.” </p>
			<p> Wu Qifeng’s expression turned unnatural when he was stopped by Huang Xiaolong. After a slight hesitation, he turned to the three of them and smiled, “Since that’s the case, I won’t bother seniors. I shall take my leave.” Bowing respectfully, he turned to leave. </p>
			<p> He quickly returned to the gates before apologizing to Ye Jingyu. After he was done, they entered the city. </p>
			<p> When they disappeared into the city, those standing around started to talk about Zhou Chi and the others. </p>
			<p> “Senior Zhou Chi?! Could he be the Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain?” </p>
			<p> “If His Highness acts so respectfully, he has to be the one!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhou Chi hasn’t left the mountain for a long time. Now that he’s here, there might be something important going on!” </p>
			<p> Many people started to become excited when they guessed Zhou Chi’s identity. After all, many celestial emperors wouldn’t be able to meet the expert ordinarily! </p>
			<p> They didn’t dare to approach Zhou Chi, but that didn’t stop them from getting to their knees. They kowtowed respectfully towards the three. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> He didn’t choose to hide his identity as he no longer had anything to be afraid of. </p>
			<p> As such, the four of them entered the city. </p>
			<p> Only after a long time after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left did those on their knees dare to get to their feet. </p>

			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t look for Chen Huanzhi the moment he entered the city. Instead, he went to Zhou Chi’s manor in the city. Existences at their level would definitely own several residences in the Limitless Land. Since the Limitless City was the core of the Limitless Celestial Empire, it went without saying that they all had manors in the city. Zhou Chi’s Ice Manor was on another level compared to the other two and the materials used in his manor were of the universe grade. </p>
			<p> After walking around, Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily, “Your Ice Manor is one of the nicest places I’ve seen.” </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi laughed and continued, “I’m glad that’s the case. When I bought this residence in the past, I planned out the entire structure. However, I cooped myself up in the Ice Mountain all these years and it’s been abandoned ever since.” </p>
			<p> “It’s really nice.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’ll head out alone tonight to experience the city life, and you won't have to follow me around.” </p>
			<p> There was a night market in the Limitless City and it was also the busiest trade market around. There would be countless treasures exchanged every day, and there might also be universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s goal of the trip was the night market there. </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord.” The three of them agreed immediately. </p>
			<p> “I’ll need your help to get me an admission pass for the night market.” Huang Xiaolong continued. </p>
			<p> With how special the items traded were, not everyone could enter the night market. Only those who had a special plaque would be granted entry. </p>
			<p> Naturally, the three of them were more than capable of obtaining a single admission pass. </p>
			<p> When the three of them went out to look for a pass, Wu Qifeng reported everything that happened to his father, the Limitless Celestial Emperor, Wu Tianyu. </p>
			<p> He mentioned about how he met Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua at the gates while bringing up Huang Xiaolong’s presence.  </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu frowned. “Blue Dragon Young Master?” </p>
			<p> He thought as hard as he could, but he failed to think of anyone who went by that title. </p>
			<p> “Where is he now?” Wu Tianyu asked. </p>
			<p> “He’s in Lord Zhou Chi’s Ice Manor.” Wu Qifeng replied. “Father, should we investigate him? Perhaps Emperor Father can summon Lin Qiankun and Rong Hua to ask them about his identity…” </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu shook his head and sighed, “It’s useless to ask the two of them now that they arrived together. Let’s do our own investigation. Look into the Blue Dragon Young Master right now! I want to know everything about him!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Emperor Father!” Wu Qifeng replied. However, he hesitated for a moment before asking, “Should we… Should we report this to the ancestor?” </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu thought about it for a second and he eventually decided against it. “Let’s not alert the ancestor. He was injured by the Dragon Overlord previously and he’s still in the process of healing his wounds. We’ll inform him when he emerges from seclusion. </p>
			<p> The night fell soon after. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong held the plaque in his hand as he approached the night market. </p>
			<p> Even though it was the largest trading platform in the Limitless Land, the night market only operated when the sun was down!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3617 – Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, Rong Hua!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong arrived, the place was bustling with activity. </p>
			<p> Even though not everyone had the qualifications to enter, there were many experts who had comprehended thirteen elements in the Limitless Land. There were also many celestial emperors among them and they were qualified to receive an entry plaque. </p>
			<p> Countless flying ships or chariots could be seen all around the giant plaza. </p>
			<p> They were all extremely rare treasures and wouldn’t be seen in the outside world. However, they were like cabbages growing by the side of the street. </p>
			<p> All of them were at the creation artifact level, and there were even several mid-grade creation artifacts among them. </p>
			<p> There weren’t many people like Huang Xiaolong who walked into the plaza. </p>
			<p> We are FreeWebNovel.com, find us on google. </p>
			<p> Moreover, everyone there had tons of bodyguards surrounding them. Huang Xiaolong was a lonely expert who came all by himself. </p>
			<p> “Which family did that kid come from? Why did he come alone?”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s solo presence was too eye-catching. With his aura, he managed to attract the attention of many young ladies. Those who had the qualifications to enter the night market were definitely princesses of the various celestial empires or young ladies of the super families. Also, most of them had yet to marry. </p>
			<p> Many young masters and young ladies went to the night market in order to look for a partner. After all, those there were probably of equal status. </p>
			<p> The person who spoke previously was the sixth young lady of the Chen Family in the Limitless Celestial Empire, Chen Hui. </p>
			<p> The old ancestor of the Chen Family was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. That made them part of the larger families in the city. However, they were far from being a top power in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> “This young man is either a supreme expert, or he’s some loser in his family. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be alone.” One of the pretty ladies beside her chuckled. </p>
			<p> The pretty lady was Chen Hui’s second aunt, Yang Rong. She was someone important since she could marry into the Chen Family and she was the daughter of the Yang Family’s patriarch. The Yang Family was stronger than the Chen Family as the old ancestor of the Yang Family was a God of Creation closing in on the half step Universe God Realm. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong smiled, “The Sixth Miss rejected so many young masters… Are you actually interested in that young man? I’ll look into him when we get back…” </p>
			<p> Chen Hui pouted slightly in response, “No I’m not! Second Aunt, you can’t make fun of me!” However, her eyes darted around mischievously and she continued, “However, I think it’s a great idea to look into his identity.” </p>
			<p> Yang Rong giggled slightly. “I knew it.” </p>
			<p> Chen Hui’s face started to turn slightly red and she widened her eyes slightly, “I’m just slightly curious… That’s all…” </p>
			<p> “Why don’t we say hello and shop around with him?” Yang Rong muttered. </p>
			<p> “That… That… It’s too awkward!” Chen Hui shook her head and sighed. </p>
			<p> Just like that, Huang Xiaolong had no idea he entered Chen Hui’s radar. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong tried to enter the night market, a random youngster appeared before him and bowed respectfully. “Lord, I wonder if you would mind if I tagged along with you…” </p>
			<p> Anyone with an entry plaque could bring two attendants with them into the night market. </p>
			<p> Glancing at the youngster, Huang Xiaolong could see the look of determination in his eyes. The kid seemed like a good man and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask, “Which family are you from? Why do you wish to enter the night market?” </p>
			<p> It went without saying that the youngster didn’t have his own entry plaque. </p>
			<p> “I am a disciple of the Gui Family in the Limitless City… I’m called Gui Xiaoer.” The young man replied instantly. “I wish to enter the night market in order to buy a bone from an ice dragon. It’s extremely important that I get the ingredient, but I don’t have a way to enter the night market alone…” </p>
			<p> “Gui Xiaoer?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Your name is pretty unique… Alright. I’ll bring you in because you make me laugh.” </p>
			<p> Gui Xiaoer was stunned. However, wild joy filled his heart in the next instant. He bowed to Huang Xiaolong to express his thanks. He begged many experts of other families only to face rejection at every corner. Even if they were willing to bring him in, they wanted a hundred million dao coins as compensation. The Gui Family was one of the third rate families in the city and there was no way they could find a hundred million dao coins even if they sold off everything they had.  </p>
			<p> Following behind Huang Xiaolong, Gui Xiaoer entered the night market. </p>
			<p> When Chen Hui saw what happened, she muttered to herself, “That young man is really kind…” </p>
			<p> Yang Rong giggled. “Let’s enter the night market. If you’re too shy to bump into him, I’ll do it for you.” </p>
			<p> Chen Hui jumped in fright and she quickly pulled Yang Rong by her sleeves, “Second Aunt… Let’s not do that…” </p>
			<p> “Nonsense! Everyone has the right to love. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. After all, you’re not a married woman!” After speaking, Yang Rong pulled Chen Hui into the plaza. </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong and Gui Xiaoer entered the night market, Huang Xiaolong explained, “Your ice dragon bone should be somewhere on the first level. You can look for it yourself. I’ll be heading up to the second level.” </p>
			<p> Those on the first floor usually dealt with ordinary herbs at the creation level. As such, Huang Xiaolong needed to go higher in order to look for universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> “Yes. Many thanks to the lord for bringing me in.” Gui Xiaoer thanked Huang Xiaolong from the bottom of his heart. “May I please know your last name? I’ll definitely pay you back in the future.” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need for that.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and waved his hand slightly. He started to head up to the second floor after speaking. 𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝙤𝙫𝙚𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> However, someone called out to him before he could enter the formation to bring him up. “Young Master, please wait!” </p>
			<p> The person who spoke was Yang Rong and she dragged Chen Hui along with her as they made their way towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When they arrived, Yang Rong smiled, “We saw how you helped the disciple of the Gui Family previously. It’s rare to meet someone as nice as you and we’re wondering which family you’re from!” </p>
			<p> She introduced herself before Huang Xiaolong could say anything. “You can call me Yang Rong. I’m from the Chen Family in the Limitless City. This is the sixth miss from the family.” </p>
			<p> Chen Hui looked at Huang Xiaolong and she felt the words getting stuck in her throat. She lowered her head slightly and she didn’t dare to look into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p> Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong introduced himself. “As it turns out, you’re members of the Chen Family! You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” </p>
			<p> “Could you be someone from the Lan Family?” Yang Rong’s eyes lit up and she asked. </p>
			<p> The Lan Family was one of the top tier families in the celestial empire. The old ancestor of the Lan Family was a God of Creation who was at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> If Huang Xiaolong was really someone from the Lan Family, he would be more than qualified to ask for Chen Hui’s hand in marriage! </p>
			<p> Chen Hui was no different as her eyes sparkled. </p>
			<p> “Nope. I’m just a wandering cultivator.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.  </p>
			<p> Wandering cultivator? Chen Hui and Yang Rong were equally stunned at the news. They couldn’t help sigh silently. </p>
			<p> However, Yang Rong’s smile quickly returned to her face and she continued, “Are you here alone? Where are your subordinates? What about your elders?” She was evidently no longer as interested in him after learning about his background. </p>
			<p> “My elders didn’t follow me over. However, my subordinates are somewhere in the city. I didn’t bring them along with me today.” </p>
			<p> “How did you get your entry plaque then?” Yang Rong couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> “I got my subordinates to look for one…” </p>
			<p> “Are your subordinates experts who have comprehended all thirteen elements?” Chen Hui, who had been standing silently at the side, asked all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> If they were, Huang Xiaolong would definitely be someone important. </p>
			<p> “Of course not. They’re not Dao Venerables. Hahaha, even so, I think you’ve heard of them.” A mischievous smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> “Oh? They should be pretty famous then? I wonder what their names are…” Yang Rong played along. </p>
			<p> “Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding their identities.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3618 – Buying a Batch of Universe Spiritual Veins?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Zhou Chi? Lin Qiankun? Rong Hua?” Yang Rong stared at Huang Xiaolong with a frown on her face. A smile slowly appeared on her face and she continued, “Are you talking about Lord Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain? Isn’t he one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land?” It was evident that she didn’t believe Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> No one could blame her. </p>
			<p> Who would believe that one of the ten strongest experts of the Limitless Land was the subordinate of a random youngster they met on the streets? </p>
			<p> Anyone who trusted what he said was definitely a fool. </p>
			<p> Chen Hui frowned. She looked at Huang Xiaolong slowly. Initially, he caught her eye because of his impressive aura and his kind heart. Now, she felt that he was someone who only knew how to toot his own horn. It seemed as though he wasn’t the prince charming she was looking for. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their reactions. “Yeah, that’s the one.” </p>
			<p> Yang Rong laughed out loud, “You’re pretty funny…” </p>
			<p> Shrugging his shoulders slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on explaining himself. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong decided to give him some advice, “Young Master, you should avoid telling others about this. If what you say gets passed around, Lord Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua might not care, but their disciples would definitely deal with you!”  </p>
			<p> “You might even drag your loved ones into this!” Chen Hui who was standing beside Yang Rong piped up all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. “Many thanks for your reminders.” </p>
			<p> “We won’t be bothered to speak to others like this!” Yang Rong explained, “We’re doing this because of your kind actions previously!” She spoke like an elder to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Finding the two of them pretty interesting, Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I thank you for your advice.” </p>
			<p> “Are you planning to buy some things on the second floor?” Yang Rong changed the topic. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. The resources I require can only be found on the second floor.” </p>
			<p> Of course, he didn’t tell them that he planned to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. Even if he did, the two of them would think that he was exaggerating. </p>
			<p> “We’re heading up there too!” Yang Rong giggled. “Let’s head up together.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject them this time and he simply agreed. </p>
			<p> The three of them entered the formation at the same time. </p>
			<p> “If you see anything you fancy, I’ll buy them for you. Let’s take it as a gesture of thanks for your reminder.” Huang Xiaolong joked. </p>
			<p> “It’s alright. We wish to buy a batch of dragon marrow. They don’t come cheap and we can’t spend your money.” Yang Rong muttered. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. 𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝓿𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> “Oh? Dragon marrow?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned. </p>
			<p> He refined many of them in the past. Before he entered the God of Creation Realm, he managed to obtain a ton of them in the Meng Tian Universe. </p>
			<p> That was where he met Gu Yuan and Long Yi. </p>
			<p> In the eyes of Dao Venerables, dragon marrow was definitely an expensive treasure. However, they were practically worth peanuts to experts in the God of Creation Realm. To the current Huang Xiaolong, they were things he could obtain at the snap of his fingers. </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Chen Hui touched her chin and continued, “We need high-grade dragon marrows and they cost more than a billion each!” </p>
			<p> Yang Rong continued, “We need several dozen of them and we can’t expect young master to pay such a huge amount…” </p>
			<p> After all, they were talking about tens of billions of dao coins. </p>
			<p> She wasn’t looking down on Huang Xiaolong. However, tens of billions wasn’t a small amount! Not even young masters of the great families would be able to bring out that much! For example, the young master of the Wei Family back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire couldn’t take out such a huge amount! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t insist after what they said. </p>
			<p> After arriving on the second floor, they could see that the entire area was built differently. The materials used were of the universe level and Yang Rong introduced, “There are high-grade dragon marrows in that shop!” </p>
			<p> As such, the three of them headed over. </p>
			<p> When they arrived, they quickly learned that there were nearly forty high-grade dragon marrows left. Yang Rong and Chen Hui quickly ordered them all. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, now that we purchased what we came here for, why don’t we look for your items?” Yang Rong asked. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and he looked around. When he locked on to his destination, he started to make his way over. </p>
			<p> From Zhou Chi and the others, he heard that there were many shops on the second floor that had universe-level spiritual veins. However, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was the entity that had the most! </p>
			<p> Many God of Creation Realm experts in the grand completion stage and above loved to trade spiritual veins for treasures. </p>
			<p> As one of the largest chambers of commerce in the Limitless Land, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce had many branches in the region. Their main mode of business was to trade universe level herbs. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong went directly towards it. </p>
			<p> When the two ladies saw where they were, they sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, are you really planning to purchase something in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?!” Yang Rong gasped. “The cheapest item here starts at ten billion!” </p>
			<p> She was afraid that Huang Xiaolong had no idea what entity the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was. </p>
			<p> “I asked my subordinates and this was the place they told me.” Without wasting any more time, he stepped through the entrance.  </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui hesitated for a moment before following him into the hall. </p>
			<p> In fact, the two of them would enter the night market from time to time. The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was somewhere they wouldn’t go normally. When they entered the place, they would only look around without buying anything! After all, they couldn’t afford anything there! They could only admire the treasures silently. </p>
			<p> When they entered the main entrance, the two of them started to tread carefully. They were afraid of drawing attention to themselves. Experts in the God of Creation Realm were everywhere in the hall. Some random old man they ran into could even be a God of Creation at the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly went to the counter in the main hall. </p>
			<p> The attendant stationed there was a pretty lady and her figure was extremely enchanting. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, can I help you?” </p>
			<p> “I wish to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. How many of them do you have here?” Huang Xiaolong went straight to the point. </p>
			<p> The attendant stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. </p>
			<p> Chen Hui and Yang Rong who were behind him felt an explosion going off in their heads. </p>
			<p> “A batch… A batch of universe-level spiritual veins?!” Yang Rong stared at Huang Xiaolong, flabbergasted.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3619 – Are You Kidding Me?&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “You… Are you joking?” Chen Hui gasped. </p>
			<p> That was the first time in her life she ever heard of someone who wanted to purchase a batch of universe-level spiritual veins! 𝑓𝑟𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸ℴ𝘮</p>
			<p> What concept was that?! </p>
			<p> Who in the world had the ability to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins?! </p>
			<p> The lady at the counter stared at Huang Xiaolong silently as she thought about the possibility of him being serious. </p>
			<p> “Brat, do you know how serious the consequences are when you mess around in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?” A sneer came from behind him all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui’s expressions changed when they saw who it was. </p>
			<p> It was a direct disciple of the Cao Family! </p>
			<p> The Cao Family was a super family in the Limitless Celestial Empire. They were second only to the royal family and the old ancestor of the Cao Family was the second strongest expert in the Limitless Land! There were rumors that his strength had crossed the 16 billion units mark!  </p>
			<p> Other than the old ancestor of the Cao Family, the Cao Family Patriarch was also one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land. He had 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy and he wasn’t weaker than the Limitless Celestial Emperor! </p>
			<p> As for the God of Creation Realm experts in the Cao Family, there were probably more than a hundred of them! </p>
			<p> There wasn’t much of a need to count those weaker than that. </p>
			<p> That was the reason behind the Cao Family’s power. Not even the Limitless Celestial Empire would dare to mess with them! Especially after the Limitless Master was injured by the Dragon Overlord! In the recent years, the Cao Family has been building up their strength openly. </p>
			<p> Even though the Chen Family was a top-tier family in the Limitless Land, they were nothing before the Cao Family. The old ancestor of the Chen Family might be at the peak of the grand completion stage in the God of Creation Realm, but the Cao Family merely needed a single thought if they wanted the Chen Family to disappear from the face of the universe! </p>
			<p> The lady standing behind the counter was equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> When the young man who sneered at Huang Xiaolong approached the counter, she recognized him instantly. </p>
			<p> “Young Master Cao Ze, welcome!” </p>
			<p> The young man nodded and chuckled, “I heard that you managed to obtain a top-grade fire dragon attributed universe-level spiritual vein.” </p>
			<p> “That’s right. Young master is really knowledgeable! We only managed to obtain it yesterday and you’re already here! I’ll get our director out here immediately.” </p>
			<p> There was no way ordinary disciples would be able to meet the director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. However, Cao Ze wasn’t an ordinary disciple of the Cao Family! He was the grandson of the Cao Family’s old patriarch, and he was also a God of Creation at the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> He was more talented than Wu Qifeng and Ye Jingyu, and his strength was also on another level compared to the two of them! </p>
			<p> When the lady behind the counter left, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, Chen Hui, and Yang Rong. </p>
			<p> “Chen Family?” He muttered. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui bowed in haste and greeted, “We greet Lord Cao Ze!” </p>
			<p> The two of them might not have seen Cao Ze in their lives, but they definitely heard of him! They knew that he was the greatest disciple in the third generation of the Cao Family. They also knew that he was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> Turning slightly, he looked at Huang Xiaolong and he mocked, “Did you say that you wanted to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins?”  </p>
			<p> “That’s right. I’ll be taking the one you mentioned earlier too.” </p>
			<p> Cao Ze was stunned. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui felt their legs going numb when they heard what he said. </p>
			<p> Cao Ze had already chosen a spiritual vein, but Huang Xiaolong went ahead and told the man he would be taking it for himself. Wasn’t he looking for trouble?! </p>
			<p> Instead of flying into a rage, Cao Ze stared at Huang Xiaolong and mocked, “Interesting. This is the first time someone dares to fight me over someone I have my eyes on.” </p>
			<p> “Don’t worry about it. Such is life.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> The blood drained from Yang Rong’s face. </p>
			<p> The two ladies started to regret their decision. They planned to make friends with the unique character that was Huang Xiaolong, but he went ahead and enraged Cao Ze! If he flew into a rage, the two of them would be buried alongside Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Cao Ze looked at Huang Xiaolong with a frown on his face. “Brat, do you know who I am?!” </p>
			<p> He felt that the only reason Huang Xiaolong dared to act so haughty was because the kid had no idea who he was. </p>
			<p> His reputation might be large, but not every bumpkin would know of him. </p>
			<p> Laughter broke through the skies before Huang Xiaolong could say anything else. “Young Master Cao Ze, it’s our honor to welcome you!” </p>
			<p> The director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, Kong Lei, appeared in the main hall and a group of Gods of Creation followed closely behind him. There were more than a dozen of them who approached. </p>
			<p> Kong Lei was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, but he was extremely passionate when welcoming Cao Ze. </p>
			<p> Seeing Kong Lei, Cao Ze no longer bothered with Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He would come to the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce every few years and he was pretty familiar with Kong Lei. </p>
			<p> After a round of pleasantries, Kong Lei laughed slightly, “Before coming, I’ve already ordered someone to bring the spiritual vein over!”  </p>
			<p> One of the God of Creation Realm experts behind him brought over a spatial ring and he released the restrictions around it. Fire spiritual qi filled the hall as a fire dragon appeared behind the man. It was the top-grade universe-level spiritual vein Cao Ze had his eyes on. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to rush things.” Cao Ze sneered. Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, he continued, “This brat over here said that he wanted to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. He wishes to buy this strand too.” </p>
			<p> Kong Lei and the experts of the chamber of commerce were flabbergasted. They looked at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. They noticed his presence when they approached, but they didn’t really care about anyone else other than Cao Ze. </p>
			<p> With a mocking smile in his eyes, Cao Ze wanted to see what Huang Xiaolong could bring out. If he failed to bring out anything, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce would definitely punish him accordingly. </p>
			<p> Kong Lei looked at the lady who was at the counter. </p>
			<p> “Yes. This young master said that he wished to purchase a batch of universe-level spiritual veins when he entered the main hall. He even asked me for the total number we had on hand.” </p>
			<p> Kong Lei stared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “I wonder what you wish to use to trade with us.” </p>
			<p> As the director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, he could easily see that Cao Ze had some beef with the man. As such, he could teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson if the items he brought out weren’t satisfactory in an attempt to kiss up to Cao Ze. </p>
			<p> Casually waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong released the restriction on one of his spatial rings. A blinding pillar of light emerged and blinded Cao Ze and the others for a second. </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3620 – I’m Doing Great&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When they finally opened their eyes, they were dumbfounded. </p>
			<p> So were Yang Rong and Chen Hui. </p>
			<p> “Creation… Creation artifacts!” 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝒷𝓃𝑜𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> They had seen creation artifacts in their lives, but that was the first time they were seeing so many of them in one place! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong practically had an entire armory in his spatial ring. There were all types of creation artifacts in there and after counting, there were more than five hundred of them! </p>
			<p> More than five hundred creation artifacts! </p>
			<p> From low-grade creation artifacts all the way to the top-grade ones Huang Xiaolong had all of them! </p>
			<p> There were axes, blades, swords, spears, halberds, whips, knives, spikes, hammers, and a ton more! There was even a top-grade creation-level flying ship! </p>
			<p> In fact, Huang Xiaolong only brought out a part of the treasures he had.  </p>
			<p> After so many years, Huang Xiaolong dealt with too many Gods of Creation and he plundered their treasuries. He no longer bothered counting and he kept all the good stuff for himself. If he only counted the creation artifacts he had, he had more than a thousand! Those he brought out were those he didn’t like! </p>
			<p> However, they were more than enough to dazzle Kong Lei, Cao Ze, and the others. </p>
			<p> A gulp could be heard in the distance as someone from the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce broke the silence. </p>
			<p> “I’m sure these are more than enough to trade for all the universe-level spiritual veins you have.” </p>
			<p> Kong Lei snapped back to reality. </p>
			<p> “Of… Of course they are!” Kong Lei forced a smile. </p>
			<p> “I’ll take everything you have, including that.” Huang Xiaolong was naturally referring to the spiritual vein Cao Ze had his eyes on. </p>
			<p> Cao Ze’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> “Brat, don’t even think of scaring us off with your creation artifacts.” One of the guards behind Cao Ze sneered, “Even Wu Qifeng wouldn’t dare to act so arrogantly in front of our young master.” </p>
			<p> The two guards around Cao Ze weren’t weak and they were at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm just like Cao Ze. Both of them had more than 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand to send the guard who spoke flying into a giant pillar in the main hall. </p>
			<p> The pillar turned to dust under the impact. </p>
			<p> The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce trembled. </p>
			<p> Everyone who came felt the ground beneath their feet trembling. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?!” </p>
			<p> “Did someone go crazy? Who in the world has the guts to make a move in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?” </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When they saw Cao Ze’s guard lying motionlessly in the rubble, no one dared to make a sound. </p>
			<p> Everyone who entered the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce were important figures in the Limitless Land. They knew who Cao Ze was and they didn’t expect someone to make a move on his subordinates! </p>
			<p> They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When Cao Ze finally processed what had happened, his expression sank. As rage filled his heart, he realized that his strength was probably comparable to his guards at best and attacking Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the greatest idea. Turning to look at Kong Lei, Cao Ze hoped that he could obtain a reasonable explanation from the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce now that his subordinate was injured in their territory. </p>
			<p> Kong Lei was well aware of the look in Cao Ze’s eyes. Moreover, he was angry that Huang Xiaolong would make a move in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. Even though Huang Xiaolong had brought out a ton of creation artifacts, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce wasn’t a place he could do as he liked!  </p>
			<p> “You’re going too far!” Kong Lei glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “My Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce isn’t a place you can run rampant!” </p>
			<p> “So what if I do? What are you going to do about it?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> “Preposterous!” One of the experts standing behind Kong Lei roared and charged at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Qian Jun was the vice director of the branch and he wasn’t weaker when compared to Kong Lei. He was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. As his hands turned into a giant claw that reached towards Huang Xiaolong, the void around them trembled. </p>
			<p> It was too bad his claw was held in place by an arm that appeared from nowhere before it could arrive. </p>
			<p> The arm that extended out from the void didn’t belong to Huang Xiaolong. Instead, it belonged to a slightly chubby middle aged man. </p>
			<p> No one knew when, but three figures appeared beside Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When Yang Rong and Chen Hui were trying to guess their identities, Kong Lei, Qian Jun, Cao Ze, and several other supreme experts in the crowd yelled, “Lord… Lord Zhou Chi, Lord Lin Qiankun, Lord Rong Hua!” </p>
			<p> “What?!” Yang Rong and Chen Hui felt their bodies trembling as they stared at the three newcomers in disbelief. </p>
			<p> They couldn’t help but think back to what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Could they actually be… </p>
			<p> The person who stopped Qian Jun’s claw was Rong Hua, the weakest of the three! </p>
			<p> Rong Hua stared at Qian Jun with a cold gaze as he casually flicked his wrist. A terrifying wave of power emerged from his body and sent the man flying. He flew straight towards Kong Lei. </p>
			<p> “Be careful!” Kong Lei’s expression changed drastically. He reached out to help Qian Jun and so did the dozens of experts around him. </p>
			<p> It was too bad they were no match for someone at Rong Hua’s level. Despite their numbers, they were sent stumbling backwards. </p>
			<p> They only managed to find their footing after reaching the edge of the hall. </p>
			<p> Cracks started to form in the wall behind them as the shockwave crashed into it. </p>
			<p> Rong Hua barely used half his strength to send all of them flying earlier. If he were to go all out, everyone in the hall would be crushed! </p>
			<p> After all, Kong Lei and the others were merely God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage. They weren’t half step Universe Gods like Rong Hua and Lin Qiankun! </p>
			<p> Everyone in the hall who were waiting for a good show to play out stared at the sudden change in situation, flabbergasted. </p>
			<p> Lord Zhou Chi of the Ice Mountain! </p>
			<p> Lin Qiankun, the old ancestor of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! </p>
			<p> Rong Hua, the old ancestor of the Glorious Celestial Empire!  </p>
			<p> What the f*ck?! Three half step Universe Gods appeared at once! </p>
			<p> One of the three was also one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> When everyone was shocked by their presence, the three of them turned towards Huang Xiaolong in unison and bowed, “Lord, are you alright?” </p>
			<p> Lord?! Kong Lei and the experts who barely managed to crawl to their feet fell back down when they heard how they addressed Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Cao Ze’s expression was the ugliest. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui’s eyes widened in shock and they found it hard to breathe. </p>
			<p> It was true! </p>
			<p> “I’m doing great! What trouble can I be in?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi and the others heaved a sigh of relief. “Of course… We were worried for nothing.” </p>
			<p> Everyone who was present felt their throats going dry when they saw the respectful expressions on the faces of Zhou Chi and the other two. They had no idea what to do now that such a terrifying figure was standing before them.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3621 – Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When everyone was still stuck in a state of terror, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Kong Lei and Qian Jun. </p>
			<p> The entire hall had already gotten to their knees. </p>
			<p> When Kong Lei and Qian Jun saw Huang Xiaolong approaching them, their bodies trembled like leaves in the wind. It was especially so for Qian Jun who tried to make a move on Huang Xiaolong. He might be the vice director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, but no one could be sure that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t kill him right then and there! </p>
			<p> When he finally arrived before the two, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “I’ll take all the universe-level spiritual veins you have. I’ll take the one he had his eyes on too. Director Kong Lei, do you have a problem with that?” </p>
			<p> Glancing at Cao Ze from the corner of his eye, Kong Lei started to hesitate. Eventually, a smile formed on his face and he replied, “Of course! We have always been fair when it comes to making deals! Lord is an esteemed customer and we welcome you with open arms! Why would we have a problem?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart. Fairness had always been dictated by those with the biggest fists. If he didn’t show off his strength, Kong Lei would never treat him as an equal. </p>
			<p> If he didn’t reveal enough power, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce would have dealt with him without a care in the world. </p>
			<p> Their trade went exceedingly smooth. With several dozen creation artifacts with one of them at the top-grade level, he managed to trade for more than a hundred and twenty universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> He threw all of them into the Sun Moon Furnace instantly.  </p>
			<p> “Do you have a problem with me?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Cao Ze and laughed, “Kong Lei decided to sell me the spiritual vein you had your eyes on. Don’t look at me… You can talk to him if you like.” </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> Kong Lei’s expression changed instantly when the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. When he looked at Cao Ze, he noticed the unfriendly look in the man’s eyes. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Yang Rong and Chen Hui who were rooted to their spot and he chuckled, “Do you want to come with us?” </p>
			<p> With her heart thumping, Chen Hui waved her hand and muttered, “There… There’s no need.” </p>
			<p> However, Yang Rong pulled Chen Hui back instantly and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong, “We’ll listen to whatever young master says.” She knew that if they didn’t leave with Huang Xiaolong right now, they would turn into Cao Ze’s targets when he left. If he chose to take his anger out on the two of them, not even their old ancestor would be able to save them. </p>
			<p> As such, they followed behind Huang Xiaolong as they left the second floor. </p>
			<p> The two ladies followed closely behind. Walking behind Huang Xiaolong, they didn’t dare to breathe loudly and their steps were light. They never thought that there would come a day when they would walk alongside one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> They didn’t dare to speak to Huang Xiaolong and neither did they dare to look at him. 𝑓𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝒷𝑛𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p> After they arrived on the first floor, Huang Xiaolong found Gui Xiaoer. </p>
			<p> “Did you buy what you need?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Nodding his head happily, Gui Xiaoer laughed, “Yes I did! Many thanks to Lord for bringing me in!” Even though he was curious about the three new figures standing behind Huang Xiaolong, he didn't think too much into it. </p>
			<p> “Alright. Let’s go.” </p>
			<p> Gui Xiaoer nodded. </p>
			<p> Soon after, they left the plaza. </p>
			<p> When they emerged, Gui Xiaoer frowned. “There was a God of Creation who made a move on the second floor… I wonder who it was. They have to be crazy!” </p>
			<p> The entire plaza felt the exchange when Rong Hua sent the members of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce flying. </p>
			<p> “Oh? It was a group of them. And they didn’t just fight on the second level. They fought in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce.” A crafty light twinkled in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and he explained. </p>
			<p> “Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?!” Gui Xiaoer exclaimed in shock. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “Yeah. Vice director Qian Jun and one of Cao Ze’s guards was taught a lesson!” </p>
			<p> “Cao… Cao Ze?!” Guo Xiaoer felt his legs going soft when he heard the name. “Are you talking about Cao Ze from the Cao Family in the Limitless City?! Is there anyone crazy enough to teach him a lesson? Could it be Lord Wu Qifeng?” </p>
			<p> They even dealt with Qian Jun of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce… </p>
			<p> No matter who it was, they were gods in the eyes of Gui Xiaoer. </p>
			<p> “That’s the one.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Oh. I was the one who taught them a lesson.” </p>
			<p> Gui Xiaoer stopped dead in his tracks and he stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. “Lord, you shouldn’t joke about things like that.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> Yang Rong and Chen Hui nearly squeaked when they heard what he said. They lowered their heads even more. </p>
			<p> After walking a little further, Gui Xiaoer cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong and spoke, “Lord, I guess we’ll part ways here. I need to return to my family.” Now that he obtained the Ice Dragon Bone, he wanted nothing more than to return to solve his problem. </p>
			<p> He bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong with a grateful expression plastered on his face. “Gui Xiaoer will definitely remember the Lord's grace. If you have time in the future, you can look for me in Huazhou City.” </p>
			<p> The Gui Family was a third rate family in the Limitless Land and there was no way they could find a residence in the Limitless City. Huazhou City was quite a distance away from the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.  </p>
			<p> Gui Xiaoer turned to leave after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s reply. </p>
			<p> “That kid is pretty good…” Huang Xiaolong remarked as he looked at Gui Xiaoer’s leaving figure. </p>
			<p> His sincere personality was only one of the reasons behind Huang Xiaolong’s praise. His talent was top notch, but it was a pity he came from a small family. If he were born in a super family and was given endless resources, he would be able to enjoy a life of glory. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the others returned to the Ice Manor, the events that happened in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce started to spread through the city. </p>
			<p> The entire city trembled. </p>
			<p> “The person who taught them a lesson is a youngster who calls himself the Blue Dragon Young Master! It’s said that Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua are his subordinates! When the three of them appeared beside him in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, Kong Lei, Qian Jun, and Cao Ze were struck speechless!” </p>
			<p> “What?! Why would the three of them surrender to the young man?! Who in the world is he?! Is he some supreme expert who came out of nowhere?!” </p>
			<p> “The Blue Dragon Young Master used dozens of creation artifacts to obtain all the universe-level spiritual veins in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. The reason behind Cao Ze’s beef with him started from a fire dragon attributed top-grade universe-level spiritual vein!” </p>
			<p> “Yeah! When Lord Zhou Chi and the others arrived, Cao Ze didn’t even dare to breathe loudly!” </p>
			<p> When the rumors were going around, Cao Ze was standing in the main hall of the Cao Family Manor with his head hung low. He was like a kid who was wronged.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3622 – Sixth Overlord&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The patriarch of the Cao Family, Cao Yixuan, frowned, “Blue Dragon Young Master?” 𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> Anyone who could force Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua into submission wasn’t a simple character. </p>
			<p> It was especially so when Zhou Chi was placed into the equation. He was an expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> “Can he be from another region?” Cao Ze muttered. </p>
			<p> “It’s possible. Get someone to investigate the Blue Dragon Young Master. Look into how he met the three of them.” </p>
			<p> Now that three half step Universe Gods submitted to an expert they hadn’t heard of before, Cao Yixuan felt that something was off. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> In the imperial palace of the Limitless Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu’s frowned as a weird light flashed in his eyes. “What a pity. He should have killed Cao Ze. When that happens, the old ancestor of the Cao Family will definitely emerge from seclusion.”  </p>
			<p> He was more than happy to see the Cao Family clash with an unknown power. </p>
			<p> Wu Qifeng reported, “The Blue Dragon Young Master first appeared in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. In the past, Jin Shi, Qin Feng, and Bai Zhou surrounded the city when the Blue Dragon Young Master was within. They were heavily injured by the Blue Dragon Young Master with a single move but he didn’t choose to kill them. Instead, he robbed them clean. </p>
			<p> “After he left, he appeared in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. After that, we failed to discover any information.” </p>
			<p> “I suspect that the disappearance of Ying Ze and Ying Wan has something to do with him.” Wu Qifeng continued. </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Wu Tianyu was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> “The two of them were last seen in the Yin Yang City. The Blue Dragon Young Master was also said to be there. After a hundred thousand years, he left for the Ice Mountain.” Wu Qifeng’s report finally ended. </p>
			<p> A frown appeared on Wu Tianyu’s face. “Do you mean to say that they only submitted to him in the recent years?” </p>
			<p> “Yes.” Wu Qifeng nodded. “However, I have no idea what the Blue Dragon Young Master used to tempt the three of them into serving him.” </p>
			<p> He seemed to have thought of something and he spoke, “Emperor father, didn’t Marshal Chen Huaizhi return to the Yin Yang City with Lin Qiankun? That was when Ying Ze and Ying Wan vanished. He might know something…” </p>
			<p> “Summon Chen Huanzhi immediately!” A solemn expression appeared on Wu Tianyu’s face. “Call him into the palace right now!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Imperial Father!” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong returned to the Ice Manor, he sent Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua to defend the perimeter as he entered the Universe Boat immediately. </p>
			<p> There were four top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and more than seventy high-grade ones in the batch he obtained! </p>
			<p> With all of them, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could break through the 20 billion units mark! </p>
			<p> In the Unknown Space, the only people whose combat abilities had surpassed God of Creation Realm experts who accumulated more than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy were the Dragon Overlord, Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death! </p>
			<p> Their combat abilities might have exceeded the 20 billion units mark, but their grand cosmos energy was still stuck below the limit! </p>
			<p> Sitting in the first layer of the Universe Boat, he took out four top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and threw them into the eye of the formation. Next, he threw in more than thirty high-grade ones. </p>
			<p> Even though he had more than a hundred and twenty universe-level spiritual veins, the first layer of the Universe Boat was unable to convert them all at once. He needed to split them into two batches. </p>
			<p> Very quickly, universe source qi poured into the space surrounding him. Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was sitting in an ocean of universe source qi. </p>
			<p> Circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art, the universe source qi poured into his body. </p>
			<p> Looking at him from a distance, he was like a vacuum that sucked up the boundless universe source qi. </p>
			<p> Golden light covered his body and they emitted faint traces of the mysteries of the universe. </p>
			<p> Several hundreds of thousands of years passed… </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong refined all the universe source qi in the space within, he tossed the remaining spiritual veins into the eye of the formation. </p>
			<p> When he was done with the second batch, another two hundred thousand years had passed. </p>
			<p> He could feel the abundant grand cosmos energy in him. When he discovered the transformation in his dao soul and dao heart, joy filled his heart. </p>
			<p> Before entering seclusion, he accumulated 19.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, he finally crossed the 20 billion mark! Even though he had barely broken through, 20 billion was 20 billion! </p>
			<p> Now, he was the Sixth Supreme Overlord in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> With his combat prowess long over the 20 billion units mark, his grand cosmos energy finally caught up! </p>
			<p> A small part of the hidden impurities in his body had once again been cleared. </p>
			<p> The only thing that disappointed him was the fact that he failed to open the second layer of restrictions. </p>
			<p> He was close, but he wasn’t quite there yet!  </p>
			<p> After emerging from the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Limitless Master has already recovered completely. He had also emerged from seclusion. </p>
			<p> “Chen Huanzhi said that the Limitless Celestial Emperor and the others have already started to suspect him. His actions are under close scrutiny.” Lin Qiankun reported. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. He wasn’t surprised that that happened. After all, Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun were completely fine while Ying Ze and Ying Wan disappeared. There was no way for them to hide everything. </p>
			<p> “Lord, I’ve also heard that an absolute treasure was born in the Sleepless Sea!” Zhou Chi continued. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the news. </p>
			<p> “Yes. It seems to be a universe treasure!” Zhou Chi nodded. “It happened several days ago and the news is still kept under wraps.” </p>
			<p> Find the original at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Universe treasure…” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly. </p>
			<p> “Yes… It’s likely that it’s the Three Gods Halberd!” </p>
			<p> The Three Gods Halberd had the power to gather all the seas in the world. With a single stab, it could tear through the heavens! It possessed unimaginable might!</p>

			<p> “Three Gods Halberd!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p> He might have the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires, he was missing an offensive treasure! </p>
			<p> Now, Huang Xiaolong was no longer interested in top-tier creation artifacts or pseudo universe treasures. </p>
			<p> The Three Gods Halberd was something Huang Xiaolong had his eyes on since learning of its power. </p>
			<p> “Do you know the exact location of the weapon?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head, Zhou Chi sighed, “The Three Gods Halberd has its own spirituality. It’s able to hide itself in the endless sea. From what we uncovered, the halberd might be in the vicinity of the Bewilderment Island. </p>
			<p> “Bewilderment Island?!” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> The Bewilderment Island was the most mysterious region in the Sleepless Sea and it was one of the ten most secretive areas in the Limitless Land.  </p>
			<p> No matter who it was, they would enter a land of illusion the moment they entered the island. Those with extremely strong willpower might be able to emerge after several years, but those who were weaker might be trapped for billions of years! There were at least ten thousand God of Creation Realm experts who tried to explore the island and more than three thousand of them had yet to emerge! There were even half step Universe Gods who had lost themselves within the island! </p>
			<p> As such, the Bewilderment Island was a troublesome place… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was confident in his strength, but he wasn’t certain that his willpower and dao heart was as sturdy as half step Universe Gods. </p>
			<p> Since a long time ago, Huang Xiaolong increased his strength by devouring the bloodline of other experts. The time he cultivated was too short compared to the top experts in the Limitless Land and he had to admit that he experienced far less compared to half step Universe Gods. 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> Whatever the case, he knew that he had to enter the island since the Three Gods Halberd made its appearance. </p>
			<p> As the Bewilderment Island was located in the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong wanted to take the chance to look for universe-level spiritual veins. Even if he failed to obtain the halberd in the end, he would be able to get something out of it. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> “Lord, that’s right.” Zhou Chi replied. </p>
			<p> “Did the Limitless Master head over?” Another question left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. </p>
			<p> With his dao souls, he quickly discovered that the Limitless Master wasn’t in the city. </p>
			<p> “What?! The Limitless Master has already left?!” Zhou Chi and the other two exclaimed. It was obvious that they didn’t discover the departure of the man. </p>
			<p> After all, the Limitless Master was much stronger than either three of them. It wasn’t surprising that they couldn’t feel his presence. </p>

			<p> “I’ll enter the Sleepless Sea tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> “Should we head over with you?” Lin Qiankun asked. </p>
			<p> “No. The fewer people the better. The Bewilderment Island is nowhere to mess around. I’ll go alone. You three can remain here to see if the Limitless Master returns.” </p>
			<p> When he emerged from the Bewilderment Island, he would decide whether or not to subdue the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race. </p>
			<p> When that happened, he would unify the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> The Limitless Master might be said to be the master of the Limitless Land, but he hadn’t unified the region. If Huang Xiaolong gained control over the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race, he would be able to create a sturdy foundation for himself in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> Zhou Chi and the other two bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> The very next day, Huang Xiaolong left the city alone. </p>
			<p> As soon as he couldn’t be seen, he charged straight towards the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> The Sleepless Sea was in the easternmost part of the Limitless Land and he took three months to arrive. If one were to cross the Limitless Sea, they would be close to the Zhu Lan, Jin Xing, and One Essence Land. </p>
			<p> Standing above the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong saw faint rays of jade light covering the ocean. The surface of the Sleepless Sea was still, but the calmer it was, the more mysterious it seemed. </p>
			<p> Tearing through the surface of the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong entered its endless depths. </p>
			<p> As soon as he did, Huang Xiaolong felt a cool sensation covering his entire body. He felt a weird energy contained in every drop of water. Due to the influence of the weird energy, those who weren’t of the Ocean Race would have their strength slightly limited. </p>
			<p> Of course, members of the Ocean Race would be assisted by the mysterious energy. </p>
			<p> It was no wonder the Limitless Master wouldn’t be able to do a thing to the king of the Ocean Race in the Sleepless Sea! </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to arrive in the largest city in the Sleepless Sea. The structures were vastly different from the cities in the human world as all the materials used were found deep in the ocean. Corals and chunks of reef were used all along the street. No matter how Huang Xiaolong looked at it, he found it a little strange. </p>
			<p> Of course, spiritual rock and essence ores found at the bottom of the ocean was used in most of the builds. Manors and palaces found in the underwater ocean didn’t lose out to those in mega cities above the surface. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother staying as he made his way towards the Bewilderment Island immediately. </p>
			<p> The Sleepless Sea might not be as large as the main continent of the Limitless Land, but it was nearly three quarters as large. As such, Huang Xiaolong needed some time if he wished to arrive at the Bewilderment Island. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chose to avoid most of the islands as he traveled in the Universe Boat. In a little more than a month, he arrived in the vicinity of the island. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Universe Boat before heading into a nearby city. </p>
			<p> “Jade Whale City!” The Jade Whale City belonged to the Jade Whale Race and they were the most ancient race in the Sleepless Sea. They were one of the strongest races present and their patriarch was the second strongest expert in the region! Only the king of the Ocean Race was able to suppress the Jade Whale Patriarch! Their position in the Sleepless Sea was akin to the Cao Family in the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Jade Whale Race could cause the Sleepless Sea to tremble with a stomp of their feet! </p>
			<p> After crossing the Jade Whale Race’s territory, Huang Xiaolong would be able to arrive on the island in three to four days!  </p>
			<p> When he tried to enter the city, he noticed that the security in the area was extremely tight. Everyone who wished to enter was forced into a round of stringent checks. </p>
			<p> “Do they do this normally?” One of the merchants trying to enter the city asked an expert beside him. </p>
			<p> “Nope. I’ve heard that someone went on a rampage in the city recently, killing a lot of disciples from the Jade Whale Race. That’s the reason behind the increased security.” Someone else said. </p>
			<p> “Are they crazy?! Who would kill members of the Jade Whale Race?! Are they tired of living?!” Someone exclaimed in shock. </p>
			<p> “No sh*t! It’s said that the members of the Wei Ghost Race did it.” </p>
			<p> “Wei Ghost Race?!” </p>
			<p> Those who heard the name of the culprits felt their expressions changing. </p>
			<p> The Wei Ghost Race might not be the most ancient race in the Sleepless Sea, but they were close. They were one of the oldest races and they were part of the ten strongest races among the Ocean Race! Their grudge with the Jade Whale Race went way back. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was about to be checked, he casually retrieved Jin Hai’s golden plaque. They allowed him to enter after ensuring that it represented the God of Creation, Jin Hai, of the Human Race. </p>
			<p> As the Human Race and Ocean Race were no longer at war, their relationship could be said to have recovered to a certain extent. The disciples from either side would definitely respect great beings from the opposing race.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3624 – Misunderstanding&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> After entering the city, Huang Xiaolong started to stroll about. </p>
			<p> Even though the Wei Ghost Race caused quite a ruckus among the Jade Whale Race, the city could be said to be bustling. Other than disciples of the Jade Whale Race, there were disciples of various other factions. Huang Xiaolong even managed to discover many experts of the Human Race. </p>
			<p> None of the humans who dared to venture into the Sleepless Sea were weak. The weakest among them were Dao Venerables who had comprehended four elements or more to perfection level. </p>
			<p> After all, no weaklings would be able to survive the journey there. </p>
			<p> Of course, the experts who went to the territory of the Jade Whale Race were people of status in the Human Race. Most of them were experts from the celestial empires. There were even generals of the various celestial empires strolling about as they were sent by the empire to buy special resources that could only be found in the Jade Whale City. They came frequently to buy something called the Jade Whale Sand. </p>
			<p> The Jade Whale Sand was one of the most precious resources in the Sleepless Sea. It could be used to refine weapons and build special structures. Everything refined with the Jade Whale Sand would contain a special water attribute. As such, experts of the Human Race were willing to pay vast sums of money for it. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was casually walking around the city, a commotion broke out in the crowd. </p>
			<p> “Murder!!” </p>
			<p> “It’s the members of the Wei Ghost Race!”  </p>
			<p> Screams filled the air. </p>
			<p> Soon after, sounds of fighting could be heard. </p>
			<p> As the battle progressed, it made its way closer to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Hurry up and protect the young lady!” Someone cried. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to see several ladies running towards himself. There were several experts of the Wei Ghost Race following closely behind. Casually looking at them, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the members of the Wei Ghost Race were Dao Venerables who had comprehended all thirteen elements to perfection level. </p>
			<p> The ladies arrived before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye. However, the members of the Wei Ghost Race caught up with them right as they did. The deadly spike in their hands shot towards the ladies. </p>
			<p> As Huang Xiaolong was standing right in front of the girls, the members of the Wei Ghost Race didn’t hesitate to drag him into it. </p>
			<p> Seeing as the spike was able to impale the ladies from the Jade Whale Race, a sinister smile could be seen on the faces of those from the Wei Ghost Race. However, their arms froze in mid air before the spikes could pierce through anyone’s body. </p>
			<p> The ladies stared at the spike that was barely an inch away from their faces with a terrified expression. </p>
			<p> Casually tapping the air, Huang Xiaolong sent the members of the Wei Ghost Race flying. When they slammed into the ground, all of them had lost consciousness. </p>
			<p> “Seventh Sister!” As the ground rumbled, an army charged towards Huang Xiaolong and the ladies. The person they called out to was the young girl standing before Huang Xiaolong. Her actual name was Bi Xi. </p>
			<p> When they heard the cry, the ladies snapped back to reality. </p>
			<p> “Third Brother!” Bi Xi cried out in fright. </p>
			<p> “Are you alright?!” The leader of the army asked while he came forward. </p>
			<p> “We’re fine. We were saved by the young master standing over there.” </p>
			<p> Cupping his fists, the leader of the army thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Many thanks for saving my sister. You can call me Bi Luo. How can I address you?” 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Everyone standing around cried out in fright when they heard the young man introducing himself. </p>
			<p> “That’s Young Master Bi Luo! I’ve heard that he’s the most talented disciple in the fourth generation of the Jade Whale Race! Some say that he’s as talented as His Highness, Ye Jingyu! His achievements in the future will be limitless!” </p>
			<p> “I wonder if he entered the God of Creation Realm…” </p>
			<p> Everyone standing around broke out into discussion. </p>
			<p> “You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong casually nodded and laughed, “It’s nothing much. You don’t have to thank me.” After he spoke, he turned to leave.  </p>
			<p> Bi Luo was stunned. </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> He was extremely famous and everyone would try to get close to him once they heard who he was. That was the first time a reaction like Huang Xiaolong’s. </p>
			<p> Before Huang Xiaolong could leave, an expert standing behind Bi Luo appeared to stop him. “Hold it right there.” </p>
			<p> “Bi Haizhou, what do you think you’re doing?!” Bi Xi yelled when she noticed what was going on. </p>
			<p> Bi Luo frowned and snapped at the man, “Haozhou, step back right now! You’re not allowed to disrespect him!” </p>
			<p> Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, Bi Haizhou roared, “Which family did you come from?! Why did you come to my Jade Whale City?! Speak! Are you working with the members of the Wei Ghost Race?! You’re definitely working together to get close to Bi Xi!” </p>
			<p> Bi Luo, Bi Xi, and the others frowned. </p>
			<p> Looking at Bi Haizhou, Huang Xiaolong raised a single eyebrow in surprise. “From what I see, you’re the one working with the members of the Wei Ghost Race. You’re probably a spy hidden in the Jade Whale Race.” </p>
			<p> “Bullsh*t!” Roaring in anger, Bi Haizhou quickly broke out into laughter, “Brat, how dare you deny the accusation?! You’re definitely trying to sow discord between members of my Jade Whale Race!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the man in amusement. “In fact, you can’t do anything to me even if you determine that I’m working with them. </p>
			<p> Bi Haizhou sneered, “Are you finally admitting it?! Bi Luo, you heard him. He admits that he’s a spy from the Wei Ghost Race.” </p>
			<p> With his expression sinking, Bi Luo growled, “Enough! Get back right now!” </p>
			<p> He revealed an apologetic expression and spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Haizhou acted out of line. If he offended you, I apologize on his behalf.” </p>
			<p> “I’ll kill a million of him with a single slap. Why would I be offended by an ant?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Bi Luo and the others were shocked. </p>
			<p> “You’re asking to die!” Bi Haizhou scrambled in rage and the spear in his hand shot at Huang Xiaolong. “I’ll kill you, you f*cking spy!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the spear completely and he slapped Bi Haizhou across the face. Like a shooting star, Bi Haizhou was sent smashing into one of the walls nearby. </p>
			<p> Bi Luo widened his eyes in fright. </p>
			<p> When they turned to look at Bi Haizhou, they saw that he was a sorry mess. He might still be alive, but he wasn’t close to death. Even though Bi Haizhou wasn’t as strong as Bi Luo, their strength didn’t differ by much. They were both close to the God of Creation Realm. </p>
			<p> “I’ll spare your life this time. If you try that again, I’ll kill you.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.  </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong threw the accusation that Bi Haizhou was a spy for the Wei Ghost Race, he was mucking about. However, he managed to hit the nail on the head, Bi Haizhou really was a spy for the Wei Ghost Race. He wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong as he was afraid that the truth would get out. </p>
			<p> It seemed as though the Jade Whale Race was a mess. There were traitors in the race no matter how Huang Xiaolong looked at it. Moreover, Bi Haizhou was definitely supported by someone high up in the race. Otherwise, a fourth generation disciple like BI Haizhou who hadn’t entered the God of Creation Realm wouldn’t dare to conspire with members of another race. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to bother with the Jade Whale Race. </p>
			<p> Getting ready to take his leave, someone else screamed, “Take him down right now! He crippled Captain Haizhou!” </p>
			<p> Hearing the scream, disciples of the Jade Whale Race rushed over to surround Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Who dares to hurt my son?!” Someone screamed and rushed towards the group. </p>
			<p> The person who arrived was Bi Haizhou’s father, Bi Shifei. He was a grand elder in the Jade Whale Race and he was a God of Creation with 3.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands behind his back and looked at the newcomer. </p>
			<p> Rushing forward, Bi Luo hastily explained, “Grand Elder, this is a misunderstanding!” </p>
			<p> Bi Shifei looked at Bi Haizhou who was stuck in the wall and killing intent filled his heart. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong before storming over.</p>

			<p> Bi Luo tried to hold Bi Shifei back, “Grand Elder, listen to me! Haizhou tried killing the man first!” </p>
			<p> Support us at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> He was quickly interrupted by Bi Shifei, “If you try stopping me, I’ll cripple you along with him.” </p>
			<p> Bi Luo’s expression changed slightly. </p>
			<p> When Bi Shifei approached Huang Xiaolong, he growled, “Even though we were ordered to avoid causing trouble with the Human Race, no one can save you today. Not even if the king of the Ocean Race comes, you’ll be leaving your life behind!” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, rays of jade-colored light surrounded his body and he started to transform into his true form as a giant blue whale. </p>
			<p> Members of the Ocean Race could transform themselves to look like a human, but they could also return into a half-beast half-human form after activating their bloodline. </p>
			<p> When Bi Shifei transformed, giant spikes grew out from his limbs. His mouth grew in size until it rivaled the size of an actual whale’s. </p>
			<p> “I’ll use my poison spikes to tear through your dao soul and dao heart! You’ll die a miserable death!” Bi Shifei snorted before rushing towards Huang Xiaolong. The spikes around his body started to glow a sinister dark blue color.  </p>
			<p> The Jade Whale Race boasted the most terrifying poison in the Sleepless Sea. There wasn’t a need to speak about how scary the poison was when unleashed by a God of Creation! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to grab Bi Shifei’s bone spike. When the inky blue poison seeped through his skin, Huang Xiaolong was completely unaffected. </p>
			<p> Bi Shifei, Bi Luo, and Bi Xi were stunned to see that Huang Xiaolong didn’t react to the poison. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong flicked his wrist. The bone spike in his hand snapped into two as Bi Shifei was sent flying. When he crashed into the wall, another giant hole formed. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t as light handed when it came to Bi Shifei. He didn’t stop when he crashed into the wall. Instead, Bi Shifei was sent flying out of the city. </p>
			<p> He was reduced into a pile of bloody flesh outside the city and like his son, the meridians in his body were torn to shreds. His dao heart was shattered and the great world in his body was in shambles. Huang Xiaolong crippled him completely. </p>
			<p> “It might be a good thing to listen to other people before you try anything stupid.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. </p>
			<p> If Bi Shifei listened to Bi Luo, he might not have been reduced to a cripple. </p>
			<p> Turning to look at the headquarters of the Jade Whale Race, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Do you want to try shattering my dao heart?” </p>
			<p> No one responded to his challenge. </p>
			<p> “Seems like you don’t plan to do anything.” Huang Xiaolong sneered before leaving. </p>
			<p> Crossing the city, he quickly departed. </p>
			<p> After he left, an old expert glared into the distance with rage eating at his heart. Killing intent clouded his mind as he clenched his fists tightly together. Despite his anger, he chose to remain silent. </p>
			<p> The old expert was Bi Haizhou’s ancestor and he was a half step Universe God. He crossed the 10 billion units mark and was ranked among the top ten in the Jade Whale Race. </p>
			<p> Bi Luo also looked at the direction where Huang Xiaolong left. </p>
			<p> …  </p>
			<p> After leaving, Huang Xiaolong went straight towards the Bewilderment Island. He crossed several other cities, but nothing noteworthy happened. In several days, he saw the island sitting before him. </p>
			<p> The Bewilderment Island was a massive land mass that stood at the bottom of the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> In the distance, it looked like a giant blue city that existed at the bottom of the ocean. </p>
			<p> Faint blue rays could be seen around it. Even with his dao eye and dao souls, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t tell anything that existed on the island. </p>
			<p> Standing there silently, Huang Xiaolong eventually decided to enter the island. </p>
			<p> As soon as he did, he noticed the entire world around him turning blue. </p>
			<p> It was as though he entered a separate world. His dao souls felt as though they were trapped in a quagmire, unable to extend out of his body even the slightest bit. His head also started to spin. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was shocked. </p>
			<p> Was that the illusory restrictions contained in the Bewilderment Island? </p>
			<p> Activating the Star Dragon Divine Tree, a pillar of starlight covered his body. With the additional help, Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls finally managed to awaken. </p>
			<p> Every single one of the thirteen universe treasures contained a mythical power. The universe origin fires had the power to refine everything while getting rid of all types of frosty qi. The Star Dragon Divine Tree had the ability to focus one’s mind while strengthening one’s dao soul. That was the reason Huang Xiaolong had the guts to enter the island. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong wasn’t confident in his willpower. Even half step Universe Gods would be trapped within for countless years, much less himself. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong regained his clarity, he started to fly towards the core of the island. However, he flew slowly as he observed everything that went on around him. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, a ray of light shot towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The light was similar to the glow that covered the Bewilderment Island, but it was extremely stealthy. If ordinary God of Creation Realm experts were not careful, they wouldn’t be able to discover it. Of course, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary weakling. He noticed it instantly, and he saw a little bug in the middle of the light ray.  </p>
			<p> The tiny bug looked grotesque. It emitted a sharp cry when it was caught by Huang Xiaolong before trying to struggle free. It was too bad it was turned into dust when Huang Xiaolong pinched it slightly. 𝒇𝒓𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> The bug was a special leech that existed in the Bewilderment Island. The poison in its body had the same effects as the formations in the island. One would hallucinate when they were bitten, and the leeches could hide in one’s body. It would feed on one’s grand cosmos energy, seriously affecting one’s strength. </p>
			<p> That was why the leeches were terrifying. </p>
			<p> They could devour more than ten thousand years worth of accumulation in a single day! </p>
			<p> After crushing the bug, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way. </p>
			<p> Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong left the region covered in light before arriving on a green pasture. </p>
			<p> The green was mesmerizing, but Huang Xiaolong knew that there was a more terrifying creature than the leeches located on the plains. They were called Death Locust and they were pretty terrifying. </p>
			<p> They could feed on one’s bloodline after invading one’s body. </p>
			<p> No one would be afraid of the Death Locusts if they were at their peak condition as they could get rid of the bugs whenever they liked. However, that wasn’t the case if their dao soul was confused. </p>
			<p> Unwilling to let his guard down, Huang Xiaolong used the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree once again. He transformed the entire space into the Star Dragon Space before entering.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3626 – The End of the Island&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Everything seemed normal when he looked at the plains from outside, but everything changed the moment he entered. Waves of green light emerged from the plains like an endless tide. </p>
			<p> The green light was much more intense than anything that could be seen in the Bewilderment Island. </p>
			<p> It was too bad the green light never managed to reach Huang Xiaolong as it was stopped by the veil of star light that enveloped Huang Xiaolong. Tiny little stars twinkled around Huang Xiaolong, protecting him from everything. </p>
			<p> After the green light failed to harm Huang Xiaolong, Death Locusts charged out from the plains and surrounded Huang Xiaolong. The leeches in the outer region of the island would attack their prey alone, but the Death Locusts weren’t as honorable as that. They would swarm their prey, overwhelming them with numbers. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy as he killed a path through the Death Locusts. </p>
			<p> A storm of bugs flew towards Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to devour him whole. Those locusts that he killed seemed to respawn when they touched the grassy plains. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong noticed someone else in the plains. The person seemed to have been swallowed by the illusory formations as he was wandering aimlessly through the plains with Death Locusts stuck on to his body. 𝐟𝗿𝗲𝗲𝘄𝗲𝐛𝐧𝐨𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝗰𝐨𝐦</p>
			<p> A huge part of those who entered would fall in the green plains just like the person before him. </p>
			<p> Soaring over, Huang Xiaolong got rid of all the Death Locusts on his body. The expert he saved was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, and he seemed to have been trapped there for countless years. The essence blood in his body was sucked dry and he was as skinny as a stick.  </p>
			<p> With a wave of his hand, a ray of star dragon qi entered the expert’s glabella. </p>
			<p> “This…” As soon as he awakened, he started to look around himself cautiously. </p>
			<p> “This is the Bewilderment Island. We’re currently in the Death Locusts Plains, and you lost yourself to the illusions.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> After his reminder, the man felt his memories coming back. </p>
			<p> “Did you save me?” With his gaze landing on Huang Xiaolong, the man widened his eyes in shock when he discovered the star dragon qi. “This… This is the Star Dragon Light?!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong easily noticed his burning gaze. </p>
			<p> Suppressing his greed, the other party cupped his fists to thank Huang Xiaolong. “Many thanks for saving me. Since fellow cultivator has the Star Dragon Divine Tree, I hope you can bring me out of the Death Locusts Plains. As long as you bring me out, I will be eternally grateful.” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to thank me. I am more than willing to bring you out. However, you’ll have to allow me to brand your soul and turn into my subordinate.” </p>
			<p> “What?! Impossible!” The man roared with anger when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s suggestion. </p>
			<p> Without saying anything else, Huang Xiaolong turned to leave. </p>
			<p> In fact, Huang Xiaolong could have branded the man’s soul when he was still trapped in his illusions. He didn’t choose to do that. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, the man was merely a God of Creation at the small completion stage. It didn’t matter whether he agreed to serve Huang Xiaolong or not. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong gave him a choice. </p>
			<p> Find the original at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “You…” Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had turned away, a flash of greed appeared in his eyes. Light swirled in his palms as he lunged towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> As they were standing pretty close to begin with, he managed to land his strike. </p>
			<p> A flash of joy filled his heart. </p>
			<p> However, a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body when the man was celebrating. He was sent flying in an instant, and by the time he landed, the bones in his hand had shattered into a thousand pieces. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong casually pointed at the man and a ray of Vermillion Bird Origin Fire swallowed him. </p>
			<p> As he continued on his way, it didn’t take long before he ran into another God of Creation. </p>
			<p> Similar to the previous expert, he was a God of Creation at the small completion stage. </p>
			<p> This time, the man knew what was good for himself and submitted to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Death Locust Plains. There were nearly seventy Gods of Creation Realm following him around. There were even several of them at the peak of the large completion stage! </p>
			<p> Of course, the strongest among them was only at that level. The Death Locust Plains might contain terrifyingly strong formations, but they weren’t enough to trap a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> Crossing the plains, Huang Xiaolong approached a world covered in flames. </p>
			<p> Magma spewed into the air as golden colored flames emerged from time to time. </p>
			<p> The occasional roars of beasts could be heard from time to time. </p>
			<p> When some of the experts behind Huang Xiaolong heard the cries, their expressions changed. </p>
			<p> That was the Flaming Mountain Range in the Bewilderment Island. </p>
			<p> From what everyone who emerged from the island said, the Flaming Mountain Range located on the Bewilderment Island was the most dangerous one in the universe! It was dubbed the Incinerated Wasteland. </p>
			<p> “All of you will have to follow closely behind me.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord!” </p>
			<p> Before entering the Incinerated Wasteland, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Star Dragon Light. He summoned the four Universe Origin Flames and the heat around them instantly lessened. </p>
			<p> Everyone followed behind Huang Xiaolong as they entered the fiery region. </p>
			<p> Stepping in the space above the mountain range, Huang Xiaolong could feel the terrifying heat rolling off the mountain range despite the protection of the origin fires. Like all the other regions, there were formations all around the mountain range. However, they wouldn’t be activated if one didn’t step foot onto the mountain. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Half a year passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> The entire group emerged from the Incinerated Wasteland without suffering much. </p>
			<p> When they did, they were greeted with a lush forest. </p>
			<p> “Looks like we’ve arrived in the Bewilderment Forest.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Lord, that’s right. This is the famous Bewilderment Forest that’s said to exist on the island.” One of the old experts reported.  </p>
			<p> In the past half a year, Huang Xiaolong saved nearly seven hundred other God of Creation Realm experts. The silver haired elder who spoke earlier was a half step Universe God. Even though he hadn’t broken through the 10 billion mark, his strength was comparable to Lin Qiankun. He came from the Zhu Lan Land and was an ancestor of one of the celestial empires. His name was Zheng Shen </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. </p>
			<p> The Bewilderment Forest was the final region he had to pass through. </p>
			<p> Along the way, he failed to find the Three Gods Halberd. If the news Zhou Chi had was reliable, it could only be located in the forest. </p>
			<p> However, the Bewilderment Forest was the most dangerous region on the island. Even leaders of various regions like the Limitless Master wouldn’t enter for fun. </p>
			<p> In the past, the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race entered the Bewilderment Forest in order to look for something. They only emerged after working together. </p>
			<p> “All of you can wait for me here. I’ll be out in a month at most.” </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen and the others bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong entered the forest. </p>
			<p> The moment he did, the demonic trees around him started to move. They spun around him, twisting the space they were in. The spinning was so intense that Huang Xiaolong felt himself getting a little dizzy.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3627 – Appearance of the Three God Halberd&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Circulating the power of space, Huang Xiaolong tried to control the contortion around him. Instead of getting better, the world started to spin even faster around him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong could only call out the Star Dragon Divine Tree when he discovered that he alone was powerless to stop it. With star dragon qi pouring out of the void, rays of light filled the space around him. </p>
			<p> The star dragon light might be able to counter the illusory formations around the island, but they were completely useless in the Bewitchment Forest. The space around Huang Xiaolong continued to twist and turn, causing Huang Xiaolong to feel a little dizzy. </p>
			<p> Signing, Huang Xiaolong didn’t panic. He started to fuse with the Star Dragon Divine Tree as countless roots pierced themselves into the cracks in space. </p>
			<p> The Bewitchment Forest finally started to lose its momentum as the roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree clamped the space around him into place. However, the spinning didn’t stop. Circulating his grand cosmos energy, a terrifying amount of star dragon qi formed a whole new world around him. </p>
			<p> With brute force, Huang Xiaolong stopped the twisting of space. </p>
			<p> When he was done, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> If not for the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong might have to remain on the island for god knows how long! </p>
			<p> A moment later, Huang Xiaolong used one of the branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree to reach deep into the disneyland. It pierced through countless restrictions as it headed straight for the core of the island. Initially, Huang Xiaolong was only able to stabilize the space around him. As the branch entered deeper into the island, the entire region finally started to settle down.  </p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> As the branch continued to stretch towards the core of the island, Huang Xiaolong discovered a massive lake that was within the Bewitchment Forest! It was several tens of thousands of meters wide, and the water shone a deep blue. The surface of the lake was as calm as the surface of a mirror. Looking at it from afar, Huang Xiaolong nearly mistook it as a giant piece of sapphire! </p>
			<p> After scrutiny, Huang Xiaolong discovered something strange about the lake. No, it was more accurate to say that there was something wrong with the water. It looked like ice created from the power of absolute frost, but it also looked like it was condensed from the power of absolute poison! Regardless, Huang Xiaolong was sure of one thing. The water was higher in quality compared to either! In fact, it was superior compared to some of the universe-level spiritual veins Huang Xiaolong threw into the Universe Boat! </p>
			<p> How could there be a lake like that in the Bewitchment Forest?! </p>
			<p> The quality of the spiritual water had exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s imaginations! </p>
			<p> With his heart trembling slightly, Huang Xiaolong turned the branch that extended deep into the cracks of space. It became a massive pillar that silently sealed off the space around the lake. Using all his power, Huang Xiaolong created a seal that boasted unimaginable power! </p>
			<p> The instant the space was completely sealed off, a massive explosion came from the middle of the lake. An object flew out from the depths of the lake as it smashed directly into the seal made by Huang Xiaolong using the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> Trembling slightly, the star dragon light that formed the barrier around the lake started to fluctuate. </p>
			<p> It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was completely prepared for any unexpected changes. After breaking through the 20 billion units mark, Huang Xiaolong was said to have reached a whole new level of strength! The object that emerged from the lake was sent flying back into the water. </p>
			<p> When it smashed into the surface of the lake, Huang Xiaolong finally saw what it was! It was a halberd that was completely blue in color! </p>
			<p> The giant halberd had three distinct runes carved into its body, and a terrifying light lingered on its tips. </p>
			<p> A burst of joy filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart. </p>
			<p> Indeed. </p>
			<p> That was where the Three Gods Halberd was! </p>
			<p> He finally located the universe treasure! </p>
			<p> A guess formed in his mind the moment he saw the lake. However, he didn’t dare to confirm anything. Now, he was finally sure of it! </p>
			<p> It seemed as though the Three Gods Halberd was tempering itself with the water from the mysterious lake! 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤ℴ𝑚 </p>
			<p> Once again, the halberd charged at the seal. </p>
			<p> A frosty light emerged from the tip of the halberd and it slammed into the light barrier above. Despite Huang Xiaolong’s accumulation of more than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy, a giant hole was blown through the barrier. </p>
			<p> Of course, the light barrier was the only thing that suffered. The Star Dragon Divine Tree remained completely intact. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, the hole closed up. </p>
			<p> Seeing as it was unable to break the seal, the Three Gods Halberd seemed to fly into a rage. Rays of light surrounded its body as a terrifying aura started to fill the space above the lake. </p>
			<p> Streams of spiritual energy rose from the lake to surround the halberd as the power it wielded continued to rise. </p>
			<p> Buzz… </p>
			<p> Once again, it tried to shatter the barrier. </p>
			<p> How could Huang Xiaolong allow it to do as it wished? He was unable to react the first time, and he wanted to see the extent of its strength, allowing it to attack a second time. Now, it was time to subdue the weapon. Like an extension of his arms, the branch of the Star Dragon Divine Tree shot towards the halberd. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, the branch and halberd exchanged countless blows. </p>
			<p> Again and again, the Three Gods Halberd was flung backwards. </p>
			<p> “Big guy, I’ll advise you to give up. This is the Star Dragon Divine Tree you’re going up against. You can’t break through its defense.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “It might not be a bad thing for you to take me as your master.” </p>
			<p> He summoned the four Universe Origin Fires after speaking up to this point. With four divine spirits materializing in the space above the lake, their roars caused the world to tremble. </p>
			<p> The Three Gods Halberd was able to control the power of water while the four origin fires could control flames. With enough heat, he could easily suppress all forms of water. </p>
			<p> “I don’t just have the Star Dragon Divine Tree. The four Universe Origin Fires have also chosen me as their master.” Huang Xiaolong continued. “If that’s not enough to convince you, I am currently refining the Universe Boat.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he summoned the Universe Boat. The might of the strongest universe treasure filled the space they were in immediately. When the Three Gods Halberd felt the aura of the Universe Boat, it stopped moving completely. It was as though it was afraid of the boat. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong thought that it was finally about to give up, a burst of light emerged from the halberd as it charged at Huang Xiaolong’s dao heart. </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong had already fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree, his dao heart was indeed one of his weaknesses.  </p>
			<p> It was too bad the halberd was stopped by the Universe Boat the moment it tried to move. The Universe Boat was like a massive mountain that blocked off every single route the halberd tried to take. An even stronger burst of light emerged from the Universe Boat and it sent the halberd flying. </p>
			<p> When the Three Gods Halberd struck the Universe Boat, it didn’t even leave a mark! </p>
			<p> As the sturdiest treasure in the universes, nothing was able to shatter its defenses! </p>
			<p> Several days later… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the halberd in his hand in satisfaction. </p>
			<p> After so many days, the halberd was finally willing to submit to Huang Xiaolong. Naturally, Huang Xiaolong had to beat it into submission. </p>
			<p> We are &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;, find us on google. </p>
			<p> He didn’t waste any time as he used the formations on the Universe Boat to crack open the defenses around the Three Gods Halberd before imprinting his dao soul brand on it. </p>
			<p> “You’re a good weapon, but your temper is really nasty…” Huang Xiaolong sighed as he suppressed the halberd in the grand formation of the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Since he didn’t wish to remain in the Bewilderment Island for long, he could only suppress the halberd before going back to refine it.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3628 – Treasure in the Limitless Sea!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> After suppressing the halberd under the grand formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave as he looked at the giant lake. </p>
			<p> Even though he had no idea what it was, he knew that it was an extremely precious treasure since the Three Gods Halberd was willing to nourish itself there. </p>
			<p> After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Sun Moon Furnace. As it trembled violently, the entire lake was sucked into the furnace. </p>
			<p> When he was done, Huang Xiaolong continued to stroll about the forest. </p>
			<p> If he managed to find something as special as the lake, there might be even more treasures lying about! </p>
			<p> A month later, Huang Xiaolong finally emerged from the Bewitchment Forest. </p>
			<p> In the month that he was there, Huang Xiaolong managed to find quite a lot of treasures. Places where the Limitless Master and the others didn’t dare to venture into couldn’t stop Huang Xiaolong! With the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong went wherever he liked! </p>
			<p> Moreover, he also managed to locate four other half step Universe Gods. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;.  </p>
			<p> All of them had crossed the 10 billion mark. The strongest of the four reached the 14 billion units mark, and she was called Yu Xiaohong. She was even stronger than Zhou Chi! </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong was like Zhang Shen. They both hailed from the Zhu Lan Lands. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Bewitchment Forest, he saw the look of panic on the faces of Zheng Shen and the others. They were clearly worried that he would never emerge. </p>
			<p> “Lord!” They rushed over to welcome him the moment he appeared. </p>
			<p> However, Zheng Shen was shocked when he saw the four people following behind Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Lord Yu Xiaohong!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Qin Wei!” </p>
			<p> As the four of them were Gods of Creation who had accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, none of them were nobodies. The four of them could be said to be extremely famous. Zheng Shen and the others naturally recognized them! </p>
			<p> “In the future, all of you will be part of the same group.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> When Zheng Shen and the others heard Huang Xiaolong, they were dumbstruck. </p>
			<p> “Alright. Let’s leave the island before talking about this.” Huang Xiaolong said before leading the others towards the exit. </p>
			<p> After his adventure around the Bewilderment Island, Huang Xiaolong could be said to be quite familiar with the place. It took him less than three months to emerge. </p>
			<p> After a short rest, Huang Xiaolong brough them all towards the depths of the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> Along the way, they ran into several strong sea beasts. Their strength were comparable to half step Universe Gods, but they were no match for Yu Xiaohong and the others! </p>
			<p> After two short months, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance of the abyss of the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> “That’s Saturated Water!” </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen pointed towards a ball of liquid and exclaimed. </p>
			<p> When everyone looked in the direction he pointed at, they were greeted with the sight of a giant water-like ball. </p>
			<p> The liquid looked extremely ordinary, but the faces of everyone changed when they noticed what it actually was. Even Yu Xiaohong couldn’t control her emotions. </p>
			<p> As long as one was swallowed by the Saturated Water, even God of Creation Realm experts who had accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy would be hard pressed to escape. Moreover, the water wasn’t just able to trap somebody. Once they were swallowed, their dao souls would enter an eternal nightmare. They would be like an ordinary drowning mortal, and the feeling was horrifying. </p>
			<p> As the ball of Saturated Water had its own consciousness, it was able to detect Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly. </p>
			<p> With absurd speed, it shot towards the group.  </p>
			<p> That was one of the reasons why the ball of water was scary. Not even half step Universe Gods would be able to outrun the ball of liquid. </p>
			<p> The presence of weird existences like that was the reason behind the Limitless Master’s reluctance to enter the depths of the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> There might be a ton of universe-level spiritual veins in the depths of the Sleepless Sea, but there were also a ton of dangers lying around! Not many people would risk their lives to search for spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to worry.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand. </p>
			<p> With his grand cosmos energy pouring into the weapon, rays of blinding light emerged from the halberd. The ball of liquid was sucked into the halberd without the slightest bit of resistance. In an instant, it disappeared. </p>
			<p> “Three… Three Gods Halberd!” Yu Xiaohong and the others exclaimed in shock. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. This is the Three Gods Halberd.” With the halberd in hand, Huang Xiaolong could control all forms of water! It didn’t matter if the Saturated Water had spirituality or not! </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong had only branded the weapon with his soul and hadn’t gained complete control over it, he was more than capable of using its basic functions. </p>
			<p> No one expected Huang Xiaolong to solve the problem so quickly. </p>
			<p> Gulps could be heard in the surrounding when they noticed the power of the Three Gods Halberd. Was that the true power of a universe treasure?! </p>
			<p> After dealing with the Saturated Water, Huang Xiaolong and the rest continued onwards. </p>
			<p> They ran into a cluster of green flames before long. </p>
			<p> Like the Saturated Water, the cluster of green flames struck fear into the hearts of half step Universe Gods. As long as one was struck by the flames, they wouldn’t be able to get rid of it no matter how hard they tried! 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝑏𝘯𝑜𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> Once again, Huang Xiaolong dealt with the danger. Summoning the four Universe Origin Flames, he devoured the burning cluster. </p>
			<p> To others, the cluster of green flames was a terrifying existence. However, it was a great nourishment for the four origin fires. </p>
			<p> ?!?!?! </p>
			<p> “What the f…” </p>
			<p> Those standing around him stared in a daze as they didn’t expect him to deal with it so easily. </p>
			<p> He brought them along as they continued to adventure around. </p>
			<p> They met with weird universe ice storms, thunderstorms, and mudslides. However, all of them were dealt with easily. </p>
			<p> As they traveled around the area, Huang Xiaolong collected one spiritual vein after another. </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong picking universe-level spiritual veins up like cabbages by the side of the street while they fell completely speechless.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong flew about the area for an entire month. </p>
			<p> “Lord, should we return?” Yu Xiaohong looked at the area around them and suggested. </p>
			<p> There might be lots of universe-level spiritual veins in the depths of the Sleepless Sea, but the further they ventured, the more dangerous it became. No one has ever been able to travel all the way into the deepest part of the sea and no one knew what dangers lurked within. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the peaceful region before him and he hesitated for a moment. “Alright. Let’s return for now.” </p>
			<p> He decided to return after entering the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. </p>
			<p> He was still a little hesitant to head deeper with his current strength. </p>
			<p> His adventure this time could be said to have yielded an extremely bountiful harvest. He obtained nearly two hundred universe-level spiritual veins and seven of them were top-grade ones. </p>
			<p> As such, he brought them back towards the shallower region of the Sleepless Sea. </p>
			<p> Along the way, he received a report from Zhou Chi. It was said that a peerless treasure has been born in the depths of the Sleepless Sea. Experts from all over the Limitless Land were charging over without a care in the world. </p>
			<p> Even the Limitless Master and Limitless Celestial Emperor had entered!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3629 – Someone Barged In&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Oh? Even the Limitless Master came…” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, it wasn’t a bad thing for him. He decided to subdue the king of the Ocean Race along with the Limitless Master after he returned. Since the Limitless Master had entered the Sleepless Sea, he would save the trouble of dealing with him after returning. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong got Zhou Chi and the others to keep a lookout on the Limitless Master. </p>
			<p> “Oh? Sleepless City?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> Was the Limitless Master looking for the king of the Ocean Race? </p>
			<p> Were they planning to work together? </p>
			<p> That might really be the case. After all, the two of them were the overlords of the region. If they wanted to search for the treasure, the king of the Ocean Race would be the best person to look for it. The Limitless Master was the strongest in the region, and his strength would be indispensable when fighting for the treasure. </p>
			<p> Perhaps, the Limitless Master already knew of the presence of the Three Gods Halberd!  </p>
			<p> “Alright. We’ll head over to the Sleepless City immediately!” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yu Xiaohong and the others. </p>
			<p> Summoning the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, they charged towards the city. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong accelerated the ship to its limit. </p>
			<p> Along the way, he received countless reports from Zhou Chi and the others. </p>
			<p> “The old ancestor of the Cao Family has also entered the Sleepless City!” </p>
			<p> “The king of the Ocean Race gathered the old ancestors of the various ancient races. The old ancestors of the Jade Whale Race, Wei Ghost Race, and the other races have gathered in the city!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed when he read the reports. </p>
			<p> Nice! </p>
			<p> They’re all gathered in one place! </p>
			<p> According to the reports, there were more than three thousand Gods of Creation gathered in the city. </p>
			<p> As for those who exceeded 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, there were nearly thirty of them! </p>
			<p> That was basically all the top-tier experts in the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> When Yu Xiaohong, Qin Wei, Zheng Shen, and the others heard the number of people gathered in the Sleepless City, complicated emotions filled their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Lord, I don’t think we should head to the city…” Zheng Shen muttered. “Even though you’re strong, we’re lacking in manpower! Shouldn’t we wait for them to split up before attacking?” </p>
			<p> “That’s right… Lord, we should deal with them when the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race leave!” Qin Wei continued. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might have the four of them who had crossed the 10 billion mark and nearly a dozen over half step Universe Gods, but they were nothing but ants before the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race! </p>
			<p> “Relax. I’ll deal with it.” </p>
			<p> To reassure them, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> As soon as it appeared, the power of the universe covered the area. The giant boat filled up the entire sky above them and none of them could believe what they were seeing. </p>
			<p> “Universe… Universe Boat?!” Yu Xiaohong gapsed in fright. </p>
			<p> They knew that Huang Xiaolong had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, four Universe Origin Fires, and the Three Gods Halberd, but the shock when they discovered that the Universe Boat was also in his possession eclipsed everything they felt in the past. </p>
			<p> That was the universe treasure that ranked first! </p>
			<p> “That’s right. This isn’t an illusion.” Huang Xiaolong admitted. Keeping the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, he ushered them onto the Universe Boat. Activating the grand formation, they turned into a streak of light that flew towards the Sleepless City. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat traveled ten times faster than the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. </p>
			<p> As the space around them started to twist, it took them several days to arrive in the vicinity of the city. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly kept the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> “We… We’re here?!” Zheng Shen stared at the city in disbelief. </p>
			<p> “Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and he started to walk towards the city. The city was on a full lockdown, and no one was allowed to enter the city. Experts of the various races patrolled the area, unwilling to let anything go wrong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and deployed the Star Dragon Divine Tree immediately. He sealed off the entire space around the city. </p>
			<p> Now that he wanted to deal with them, he wouldn’t allow anyone to escape. The Star Dragon Divine Formation was strong enough to stop anyone from escaping. </p>
			<p> With the grand formation sealing off the space around the city, not even the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race would be able to escape. After all, they weren’t stronger than Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> With rays of starlight silently covering the area, it formed a giant spider web that stretched into the space around the city. The ray of light grew stronger and stronger as the space became extremely stable. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was laying down his formation, there was a discussion going on in the main hall of the Sleepless Palace. The Limitless Master, Wu Xin, and the king of the Ocean Race, Ye Ye, were discussing the matter of the treasure among each other. </p>
			<p> “We’re nearly done with our preparations.” Wu Xin said, “It’s time for us to head towards the Bewilderment Island.” </p>
			<p> “Alright, let’s head over tomorrow! Brother Wu Xin, is that alright with you?” </p>
			<p> “Of course.” Wu Xin laughed. “However, let’s be clear about this. The Three Gods Halberd will belong to whichever side who finds it first. We’re not allowed to come to blows over the weapon.” </p>
			<p> “Naturally.” Ye Ye chuckled. “I’m afraid that Brother Wu Xin will go against our agreement when the treasure really appears.” </p>
			<p> “Nonsense! You’re the master of the Sleepless Sea. I won’t be able to go against our agreement even if I wanted to!” </p>
			<p> The two of them laughed casually. </p>
			<p> The Three Gods Halberd might be in the Bewilderment Island, but the island itself was terrifying! Neither one of them dared to venture in alone. As such, they came to an agreement to work together in order to find the treasure! </p>
			<p> “We must not allow news of the halberd to leave this hall…” Ye Ye warned everyone who was present.  </p>
			<p> That was what the two of them were most worried about. </p>
			<p> Everyone might know that a treasure appeared in the Sleepless Sea, but no one knew that it was the Three Gods Halberd. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin nodded solemnly, “Brother Ye, you can rest assured that none of us will leak the news.” </p>
			<p> He knew how serious things were. If the news that a universe treasure had appeared in the Sleepless Sea were to spread, the five supreme overlords would rush over at once! The two of them wouldn’t be left with scraps! Like what happened to the Limitless Master when the Dragon Overlord came to seal his treasure map, the two of them might even be severely injured! 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> They were about to leave the hall when a massive explosion rang in their ears. The entire city trembled under their geet. </p>
			<p> Every single expert in the hall was shocked. There was only one explanation for the shaking. Someone attacked the Sleepless City! </p>
			<p> With so many experts stationed in the city, someone was crazy enough to launch an assault! </p>
			<p> Did someone leak the news of the Three Gods Halberd?! </p>
			<p> Wait a minute, the halberd hasn’t even appeared! Why was someone attacking the city?! </p>
			<p> One of the experts from the Sleepless City rushed into the hall. He got to his knees and made a report, “Your Majesty, someone barged into the city and wounded many experts on our side!”</p>

			<p> “Just… Just one! It’s a youngster from the Human Race!” </p>
			<p> Youngster from the Human Race?! </p>
			<p> Everyone in the hall stared at each other as an awkward silence filled the area. </p>
			<p> Ye Ye opened the dao mirror in the grand hall and they saw a youngster strolling into the Sleepless City. Not a single guard could stop the man, and all of them were sent flying by a formless energy when they approached. </p>
			<p> Wu Qifeng and Ye Jingyu gaped in shock when they saw the person in the dao mirror. “It’s him!”  </p>
			<p> Their reactions caused Ye Ye and Wu Xin to stare at them in bewilderment. </p>
			<p> “Do you know him?” Wu Xin asked Wu Qifeng when he saw the animated expression on the latter’s face. </p>
			<p> “Lord Ancestor, that’s the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Wu Qifeng didn’t dare to hesitate as he quickly made the report. </p>
			<p> Ye Ye was equally as confused. In the past, Ye Jingyu entered the Limitless Celestial Empire and reported the fact that Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua had submitted to a youngster. He was curious about their relationship, but he wasn’t too concerned. </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu looked at Huang Xiaolong and he frowned, “What do you think he’s trying to do?” </p>
			<p> The Blue Dragon Young Master definitely knew that there were countless experts residing in the Sleepless City. Even so, he decided to attack the city alone! </p>
			<p> What in the world was he up to?! </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu and the various experts in the hall were clueless as to Huang Xiaolong’s intentions. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin looked at Ye Ye and muttered, “Brother Ye, how strong do you think he is?” </p>
			<p> “His strength hasn’t crossed the 14 billion units mark!” Ye Ye declared after observing Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He was right. The strength Huang Xiaolong displayed hadn’t crossed the 14 billion units mark. After all, he only used two great worlds. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin nodded his head and muttered, “He probably has a little more than 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy. However, it’s not possible for him to subdue Zhou Chi if that was the case…” </p>
			<p> “Father, there might be a supreme overlord supporting the kid!” Wu Tianyu guessed. “That should be the reason behind his subordinates’ obedience…” </p>
			<p> Ye Ye frowned and looked at the patriarch of the Jade Whale Race. “Patriarch Bi Chengyin, teach him a lesson! If he doesn’t know what’s good for him, teach him a lesson he will never forget!” </p>
			<p> Getting to his feet, Bi Chengyin bowed before leaving the hall. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin looked at Bi Chengyin who was headed for Huang Xiaolong and he laughed, “Patriarch Bi has already broken through the 16 billion units mark. Brother Ye is fortunate to have such a capable general!” </p>
			<p> Ye Ye chuckled in amusement, “Brother Wu Xin, there’s no need to be envious of me. You have a ton of experts under you too…” </p>
			<p> The two of them laughed casually. </p>
			<p> Opening their dao eyes, the two of them decided to watch the upcoming battle. </p>
			<p> In a few steps, Bi Chengyin arrived before Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> By the time he arrived, Huang Xiaolong had already entered the inner city. </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong and the others didn’t follow him during his assault on the Sleepless City as they would be nothing more than a burden to him during the final battle. They were no match for the Limitless Master or the king of the Ocean Race anyway! Huang Xiaolong felt that they would be better off supporting the formation on the outside, preventing anyone from getting away. </p>
			<p> When Bi Chengyin stood before Huang Xiaolong, he touched his chin and growled, “Were you the one who crippled Bi Shifei?” </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong grinned. “Are you the second strongest expert of the Sleepless Sea?” </p>
			<p> “If you cripple one of your arms now, you can leave.” Bi Chengyin muttered. “The Sleepless City isn’t somewhere you can come and go as you please.” 𝘧𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> “What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> “Then it won’t end with you losing one of your arms. If you refuse to heed my advice, you’re going to suffer a miserable death.” </p>
			<p> “Try me.” Huang Xiaolong said as he took a step forward. </p>
			<p> Under the gaze of everyone in the hall, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Bi Chengyin. </p>
			<p> With his expression sinking, Bi Chengyin growled, “Do you really think that I’ll spare you because of the courage you’ve shown?! I detest delusional kids like you!” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he made his move. </p>
			<p> He appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye as he grabbed at Huang Xiaolong’s arms. Since the youngster before him wasn’t willing to listen to his warnings, he would cripple both his arms! It would count as a small lesson. </p>
			<p> He managed to grab Huang Xiaolong’s arms without much difficulty. </p>
			<p> Tightening his fists, he wanted to tear Huang Xiaolong’s arms off his shoulders. However, he soon discovered that he wasn’t able to do a thing to the youngster before him! Huang Xiaolong’s arms were like massive rods made from the strongest of universe materials! His hands actually hurt from squeezing too hard! </p>
			<p> He stared at Huang Xiaolong as confusion filled his mind. </p>
			<p> How in the world could someone refine their body to such a terrifying degree?! </p>
			<p> In the main hall, Ye Ye and Wu Xin were equally dumbstruck. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?! Did he wear some sort of pseudo universe treasure level armor?!” </p>
			<p> As the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong moved. The second strongest expert of the Sleepless Sea, Bi Chengyin, was sent flying when Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders once. Blood sprayed out from his lips. </p>
			<p> “What?!”  </p>
			<p> No matter who it was, they failed to contain their shock. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin and Ye Ye leaped to their feet as their expressions changed drastically. </p>
			<p> Staring at each other, they took a single step and appeared before Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The experts who were in the hall followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> “Do you have any business in my Sleepless City?” Ye Ye growled. “Who are you anyway?” </p>
			<p> “Aren’t all of you looking for the Three Gods Halberd?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin and Ye Ye frowned. </p>
			<p> Did someone leak the news of the universe treasure?! </p>
			<p> “You must be mistaken.” Ye Ye explained in a low voice, “I invited Brother Wu Xin here to discuss matters between my Ocean Race and his Human Race.” </p>
			<p> “Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong laughed and summoned the Three Gods Halberd.</p>

			</title>
			<p> “Three Gods Halberd!” </p>
			<p> Ye Ye and Wu Xin yelled the instant they saw the weapon. </p>
			<p> They charged at Huang Xiaolong in unison. </p>
			<p> Their reactions were quick and their actions were ruthless. </p>
			<p> Instead of hiding, Huang Xiaolong waved the Three Gods Halberd to welcome their assault. </p>
			<p> The instant it shot out, rays of light filled the skies. Everyone felt as though the Sleepless Sea was drained of energy as all of it gathered on the tip of the halberd. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin and Ye Ye gasped in fright. They summoned their pseudo universe treasures instantly in a desperate attempt to block Huang Xiaolong’s strike. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin used a giant blade while Ye Ye used a halberd. From what it seemed, Ye Ye’s halberd was based on the design of the Three Gods Halberd! </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, the two of them were far too weak compared to Huang Xiaolong. No matter in terms of treasures or cultivation, they were far too lacking. When the Three Gods Halberd came into contact with the two weapons, they shattered instantly!  </p>
			<p> The shards of their weapons flew back towards them without any mercy. </p>
			<p> Pushing themselves to the limit, Ye Ye and Wu Xin could only use their fists to defend themselves against the shards and the incoming Three Gods Halberd. </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> Trembling slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t let up as the Three Gods Halberd swept towards the two of them. </p>
			<p> It sliced through the divine armor on their bodies effortlessly. In the face of such a terrifying weapon, their clothes and armor were comparable to soft tofu! The impact of the strike wasn’t soft either and the two of them were sent flying. </p>
			<p> Find the original at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> A loud blast rang through the skies as the two of them smashed into the walls surrounding the city. </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu and the others could see the bones that were revealed by the wounds Huang Xiaolong inflicted. </p>
			<p> Everyone sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> Ye Ye and Wu Xin could be considered monsters in their own right! It was especially so for Wu Xin who was an ancient existence! He managed to survive the ancient universe tribulation with his fleshy body alone, and his physical body should possess a terrifying level of defense! Even so, he was nearly sliced in two by Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Despite their severe wounds, the two of them got to their feet. Even though they were shocked by the power of the Three Gods Halberd, they were even more surprised by the strength Huang Xiaolong possessed! </p>
			<p> Experts weaker than Wu Xin and Ye Ye might have noticed the overwhelming power of the halberd, but the two of them realized how strong Huang Xiaolong was! </p>
			<p> If they were strictly talking about strength, the youngster before them would definitely rank among the top ten in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> No… He might be even stronger than that! </p>
			<p> Cupping their fists in fright, Ye Ye bowed respectfully, “We offended Lord Blue Dragon earlier… Please forgive us.” </p>
			<p> “That’s right. We unknowingly offended Lord Blue Dragon… Please forgive us.” Wu Xin did the same. </p>
			<p> Wu Tianyu and the others felt their jaws dropping in fright when they heard what their leaders said. That was the first time they saw the two leaders acting so humbly! </p>
			<p> “Offended me unknowingly?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “Don’t you wish to grab my Three Gods Halberd?” </p>
			<p> A flame ignited in their hearts once again when they thought about the universe treasure in his hand.  </p>
			<p> “Lord, you must be joking!” Wu Xin suppressed the greed in his heart and laughed. </p>
			<p> “Actually, I’m here to achieve a single goal.” Huang Xiaolong turned serious all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> The hearts of those present tightened. </p>
			<p> “Alright, it doesn’t matter if I tell you… I’m from the Thirteen Universes!” Huang Xiaolong declared. </p>
			<p> “Thirteen Universes!” The members of the Limitless Land gasped in shock. The Blue Dragon Young Master actually came from the thirteen universes! </p>
			<p> “I came to the Unknown Space to look for a group of subordinates.” He paused for a second when he spoke up to this point. </p>
			<p> Even though he didn’t finish his sentence, the members standing around him knew what he meant. Their expression sank instantly. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin sneered with rage, “Blue Dragon Young Master, you have to be kidding me. Do you think we will submit to you?!” </p>
			<p> Ye Ye continued, “Are you stuck in a day dream?” </p>
			<p> “Well, you’ll know if I’m day dreaming in a bit.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> “You might be strong, but do you really think that you can suppress my Ocean Race by yourself?!” With rays of light emerging from his body, the wound in his chest closed and he yelled, “Attack! All of you, activate the Sleepless Formation! Kill!” </p>
			<p> “Members of my Limitless Celestial Empire, listen to me! Lay down the Limitless Formation and take him down right now!” Wu Xin roared. </p>
			<p> The moment their orders left their lips, the experts of the two factions sprung into action. </p>
			<p> Streams of blue light emerged from the heads of the experts from the Ocean Race. An ancient power hidden deep in their bloodlines started to activate. 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> The entire Sleepless Sea started to tremble. </p>
			<p> The originally calm surface of the sea was broken by waves millions of miles high. </p>
			<p> A terrifying power covered the entire sea. </p>
			<p> In that instant, everyone felt as though a mountain was pressing down on their bodies. </p>
			<p> As for the members of the Limitless Celestial Empire, they did pretty much the same thing as the members of the Ocean Race. A boundless strength seemed to emerge from the depths of the space.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was completely impassive when he looked at them. No longer holding back, Huang Xiaolong activated all three great worlds as grand cosmos energy poured out of his body. More than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy filled the skies around. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> As soon as he revealed his strength, the entire city sank by several inches. It was clear that the meticulously refined city was unable to withstand the power coming from Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Soon after, the ground started to crack as the structures around them started to crumble. </p>
			<p> Ye Ye and Wu Xin felt despair forming in their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Are you already…” </p>
			<p> “That’s right. I have already crossed the 20 billion mark.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Moreover, I have three great worlds!” </p>
			<p> “Three?!” Everyone gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> As Huang Xiaolong’s aura continued to rise, the Sleepless City that had existed for god knew how many years, started to crumble. </p>
			<p> Like dominoes, the building in the city fell one by one!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3632 – Unifying the Limitless Land&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> With the revelation of his grand cosmos energy, the experts of the two factions felt as though a formless pressure was pressing down against them from the heavens. Their auras were completely suppressed by an even more terrifying power! </p>
			<p> When they were feeling despair, the Three Gods Halberd in Huang Xiaolong’s hand shot out towards them. </p>
			<p> “Defend!” </p>
			<p> Wu Xin roared in fright. </p>
			<p> Ye Ye did the same and ordered for the members of the Ocean Race to raise their defenses. </p>
			<p> Vortexes appeared around the bodies of those from the Limitless Celestial Empire and when they gathered together, they emitted a weird power that seemed to tear the space apart. </p>
			<p> Waves gathered before the members of the Ocean Race and they eventually combined to form long blue dragons. </p>
			<p> Rip! </p>
			<p> Tearing through their defenses like it was nothing, the Three Gods Halberd continued on to its target.  </p>
			<p> Pillars of light emerged from the tip of the halberd and they were like arrows that shot towards every single enemy before him. Not a single one of them remained standing and Huang Xiaolong summoned the origin flames. </p>
			<p> The four Universe Origin Fires turned into a giant ball of fire that clashed with the blue dragons summoned by the Ocean Race. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> They were sent tumbling away as the flames returned to Huang Xiaolong’s side. </p>
			<p> “Universe Origin Fires!” Wu Xin and Ye Ye yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> “Hurry up and surrender.” Huang Xiaolong snorted. </p>
			<p> However, Wu Xin sneered in response, “Who would have thought that you would also possess the Universe Origin Fires? Even so, you can’t stop us from escaping! Once we leave this place, the news of your treasures will definitely reach the ends of the Unknown Space!” </p>
			<p> When you're just trying to make great content at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “When that happens, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death will look for you along with the masters of the other regions!” Ye Ye laughed. “What do you think will happen then?” </p>
			<p> “Dumb*ss! You shouldn’t have showed off your treasures!” </p>
			<p> After they spoke, they tried to leave the city. However, they were stopped by a barrier of light. </p>
			<p> “Star… Star Dragon Divine Tree!” They stared at the roots that were slowly extending out from the cracks in space in disbelief. </p>
			<p> “Yeah. I laid down the Star Dragon Divine Formation before entering the city. No one can leave the city.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You will never be able to shatter the formation unless you manage to defeat me.” </p>
			<p> The expressions of the two leaders turned extremely unsightly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong started walking towards them.. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> A day later… </p>
			<p> The experts of the two factions bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> That included Ye Ye and Wu Xin. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laid down restrictions in their dao sound before getting Wu Xin and Ye Ye to remove all their memories of the treasures they witnessed. Only when they were done did he remove the formation around the city. </p>
			<p> Since he was done with the two factions, he got Ye Ye to search for the members of the Cao Family. In the span of a single afternoon, he led the experts of both factions over to surround the members of the Cao Family. </p>
			<p> In the next few years, Huang Xiaolong used the power under his command to subdue every single ancient race and celestial empire in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> When he was finally done, he controlled the entirety of the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> Due to his secretive actions when he subdued Ye Ye and Wu Xin, he didn’t alert any of the other supreme overlords. </p>
			<p> According to the reports to the outside world, Ye Ye worked together with Wu Xin to completely dominate the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> Several years later, Huang Xiaolong entered the Universe Boat and he continued to cultivate. </p>
			<p> Since the Limitless Land was unified, all the universe-level spiritual veins they collected were sent over to Huang Xiaolong as tribute. 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> The number of spiritual veins he gathered totaled more than eleven hundred! </p>
			<p> There were more than 40 top-grade universe-level spiritual veins, and there were more than two hundred top-grade ones! </p>
			<p> When he looked at them, Huang Xiaolong finally felt like he was a wealthy man. </p>
			<p> Sitting in the first layer of formations on the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong threw several spiritual veins into the eye of the formation. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, two hundred thousand years passed.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong refined thirty top-grade universe-level spiritual veins in the years that passed and the grand cosmos energy in his body reached the 20.999 billion mark. </p>
			<p> Another hundred thousand years passed… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong finally stopped cultivating and a frown appeared on his face. After so many years, he finally refined all the top-grade spiritual veins! Even so, he failed to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! No matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn’t cross the 21 billion mark! </p>
			<p> It seemed as though he couldn’t enter the grand completion stage if he didn’t clear away the impurities in his body. </p>
			<p> However, there was almost sixty percent of it left in him! </p>
			<p> There was no way for him to get rid of it in a short amount of time! </p>
			<p> The only good news was that he managed to open the second layer of formations. As long as he had enough universe source qi, he would be able to clear away all the impurities in the next million years. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Universe Boat and summoned the two leaders. After learning about the recent happenings in the Limitless Land, he returned to the Universe Boat to enter the second layer of formations. </p>
			<p> Eight hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> A burst of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body one fine day, and the sound of something shattering could be heard coming from his body. A terrifying storm was swept up with Huang Xiaolong at its core.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3633 – Breaking Through&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The storm had the power to end worlds! Despite the terrifying defensive abilities of the Universe Boat, it started to sway back and forth! </p>
			<p> The three great worlds in Huang Xiaolong’s body were like suns that glowed with the intensity of a billion stars. The golden light they emitted could blind even the strongest of men! </p>
			<p> Several hours passed as the three great worlds in his body trembled non-stop. </p>
			<p> Terrifying might filled the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Luckily for him, Huang Xiaolong broke through in the grand formation in the Universe Boat. As it was separated from the outside world, Huang Xiaolong didn’t cause a ruckus out there. Otherwise, the storm would definitely shake up the regions around the Limitless Land! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong became at least two times stronger than before! </p>
			<p> The aura he emitted shot up like a rocket. </p>
			<p> It continued for an entire world before slowly slowing down. </p>
			<p> The golden light around his body slowly receded.  </p>
			<p> Several days passed and Huang Xiaolong finally opened his eyes. Sucking in a long breath, a flash of joy crossed his eyes. After more than eight hundred thousand years of cultivation in the second layer of formations in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong finally entered the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! </p>
			<p> Before breaking through, his grand cosmos energy was stuck under the 21 billion mark! Now that he did, he finally tore through the invisible barrier! </p>
			<p> As for the hidden impurities in his body, he cleared them all! </p>
			<p> He only managed to regain his calm after a few moments. </p>
			<p> Retrieving the universe-level spiritual veins he had left, he discovered that there were more than six hundred of them left! </p>
			<p> Throwing all of them into the eye of the formation, Huang Xiaolong decided to replenish the amount of universe source qi in the second layer of formation. </p>
			<p> A bitter smile appeared on his face when he thought about his feelings before entering seclusion. When he looked at the spiritual veins he had in the past, he felt like a wealthy man. Now, he realized that they weren’t enough! </p>
			<p> At the very most, he would be able to supply enough universe source qi for the next hundreds of thousands of years. </p>
			<p> Without leaving the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate. </p>
			<p> More than three hundred thousand years passed… </p>
			<p> When he refined all the universe source qi, he finally emerged from the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> His seclusion lasted more than 1.5 million years from the time he subdued the Limitless Land, and he not only broke through to the grand completion stage. He also managed to accumulate 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p> As soon as he emerged, he summoned Wu Xin and Ye Ye to ask about the changes in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> Very quickly, he received all the reports. </p>
			<p> “Lord, the ancestor of the Jian Family broke through. The grand cosmos energy in his body transformed, and his combat abilities surpassed the 20 billion mark.” Ye Ye seemed to have thought of something and he sighed, “The matter shook the Unknown Space and he has been crowned as the sixth supreme overlord!” </p>
			<p> “Oh? Jian Wushuang broke through?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the news. </p>
			<p> “Yes. He broke through nearly five hundred thousand years ago.” Wu Xin explained. “After breaking through, he entered seclusion immediately. He only managed to emerge several days ago, and the Jian Family is planning for a celebratory ceremony.”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. </p>
			<p> It was natural for the Jian Family to celebrate such a heaven shaking matter. After all, becoming one of the supreme overlords was no small achievement! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts couldn’t help but turn to Tao Han’er. She was brought away by the experts of the Jian Family previously but he didn’t know how she was doing. </p>
			<p> “How is Tao Han’er’s situation in the Jian Family?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask. </p>
			<p> Before entering seclusion, Huang Xiaolong requested for them to pay some attention to Tao Han’er. </p>
			<p> “She is heavily regarded in the Jian Family. Moreover, her talent is nothing to scoff at. The Jian Family has been giving her all the resources she needs. After so many years, she has already broken through to the Dao Venerable Realm. She is currently a Second Esteem Dao Venerable, and her comprehension of the sword dao is extremely high! Jian Wushuang intends to impart his knowledge to her.” Wu Xin replied respectfully. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> When the members of the Jian Family brought her away, Huang Xiaolong didn’t say anything as he knew that they would treat her well. </p>
			<p> When you're just trying to make great content at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> However, Jian Wushuang’s intention to impart his cultivation to her surprised Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er might be his granddaughter, but Jian Wushuang had countless descendants! There were quite a number of them with decent talent, but since Tao Han’er had been chosen by him, her future was limitless! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Zhu Family soon. </p>
			<p> “Get someone to bring Tao Hang over from the Yin Yang City.” Huang Xiaolong ordered. </p>
			<p> “Tao Hang?” Wu Xin raised an eyebrow in surprise. </p>
			<p> Who in the world was Tao Hang?” 𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝒏𝓸𝒗𝓮𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> “In the past, he was hunted down by the members of the Tao Family and seeked refuge in the Golden Sea City. He saved Tao Han’er, and he can be considered her foster father. He’s currently residing in the Yin Yang City.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin understood Huang Xiaolong’s intentions immediately. He bowed before sending down the order to bring Tao Hang over.  </p>
			<p> “Zhu Lan Land…” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden as he turned to look in their direction. </p>
			<p> Since he was done with the Limitless Land, he planned to head over to the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> Even without Tao Han’er’s matter, he would definitely be taking a trip down there. </p>
			<p> The Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen might be known as the five supreme overlords in the Unknown Space, but they weren’t at the same level. From what Wu Xin said, Huang Xiaolong learned that Zhu Chen was the weakest of the five. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen’s combat prowess should be close to the 22 billion unit mark. </p>
			<p> As for the strongest, it was said to the the Ferocious Devil. </p>
			<p> No one knew how strong he actually was. Not even Zhu Chen and the other supreme overlords know how strong he was. That was because no one had ever forced the Ferocious Devil to go all out! Whatever the case, they knew that the Green Ghost who was ranked second among them had combat abilities close to an expert with 25 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord was ranked third, and the God of Death was ranked after that. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong estimated his strength and realized that he was probably as strong as the God of Death if he didn’t use any of his treasures. If he used all four universe treasures, he would definitely be able to suppress the God of Death! </p>
			<p> As for the Dragon Overlord who ranked third, Huang Xiaolong felt that there was quite a bit of distance between them. As such, if he were to reveal his strength, he would immediately push the God of Death down to fifth place!</p>

			<p> As the distance was pretty large, Tao Hang needed several years in order to arrive in the Limitless Celestial Empire. In the years that followed, Huang Xiaolong decided to continue refining the Three Gods Halberd. </p>
			<p> With his current strength and the help of the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires refining the Three Gods Halberd was much smoother than before. </p>
			<p> Several years later, Huang Xiaolong completely refined the halberd before Tao Hang arrived. </p>
			<p> “Tao Hang greets the lord!” Tao Hang bowed the moment he arrived before Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> From Lin Qiankun, he learned that Huang Xiaolong has already unified the Limitless Land. The Limitless Master, Wu Xin, and the king of the Ocean Race, Ye Ye, were his subordinates. </p>
			<p> As such, he knew that the real person in charge of the Limitless Land was no longer the Limitless Master. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need for formalities between us. Please get up.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw Tao Hang again. </p>

			<p> Tao Hang was the first person he met when he arrived in the Unknown Space. He didn’t treat them as subordinates as they didn’t do anything to him when they first met.  </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord.” Tao Hang thanked as he got to his feet. </p>
			<p> “You improved pretty quickly… Looks like you didn’t waste your time.” Huang Xiaolong praised when he noticed Tao Hang’s cultivation level. </p>
			<p> It has been more than a million years. Tao Hang has already entered the Dao Venerable Realm since they last met. Even though he barely broken through, a Dao Venerable was still a respectable figure no matter where he went. </p>
			<p> Of course, there were four beast kings who gave him pointers during his cultivation, but everything relied on one’s effort. </p>
			<p> “Lord is too kind…” Tao Hang smiled and he felt a burst of warmth filling his heart. “I got to where I am today because of Lord’s grace.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong no longer dwelled on the subject and he quickly moved on to the main topic. “I summoned you as I plan to bring you with me over to the Zhu Lan Land.” </p>
			<p> “Zhu Lan Land?!” </p>
			<p> Along the way, he wondered why Huang Xiaolong wanted to see him. He didn’t expect that the man would bring him to the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> However, he quickly realized the reason. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. Tao Han’er was brought away by the members of the Jian Family in the past, and all of us haven't seen her since then. You’re her foster father and I believe that she’ll be more than happy to meet you after so many years!” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> With joy filling his heart, Tao Hang bowed once again, “Tao Hang is extremely grateful for the opportunity.” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to thank me!” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Go get ready and we’ll leave first thing tomorrow morning.” </p>
			<p> There was nothing for Tao Hang to pack. However, he went straight to the market in the city to get things Tao Han’er would like. </p>
			<p> The very next day… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong brought Tao Hang as they headed towards the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> Other than the two of them, Yu Xiaohong, Zheng Shen, and the others were present. There were more than eighty Gods of Creation following them. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong saved over 600 experts on the island, he learned that over eighty of them were from the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> That was also the reason Huang Xiaolong brought them along. </p>
			<p> In order to hasten his travel, Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat tore through the skies as it changed straight towards the Sleepless Sea. No matter how many beasts they ran into, Huang Xiaolong smashed through them all! Naturally, no one could survive a single hit from the speeding ship. </p>
			<p> Despite their terrifying speed, half a year passed before Huang Xiaolong arrived at the borders of the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> Standing in the space above, Huang Xiaolong felt the difference in the space laws and the spiritual qi in the air. As one of the five strongest regions, the laws of space in the area was much stronger. The spiritual energy in the air was also much purer than the Limitless Land. 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong released Zhu Qiming and Hao Jing from the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> The moment they appeared, wild joy formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “Zhu Lan Land!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> A sinister smile formed on Zhu Qiming’s face. He sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would dare to step foot in my Zhu Lan Land?! Did you eat the wrong medicine this morning?!” </p>
			<p> “Your Zhu Lan Land?” A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Well, it won’t belong to you soon. Take your time to enjoy the sights.” </p>
			<p> After taking down the Limitless Land, Huang Xiaolong had long since set his sights on the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> Staring at Huang Xiaolong for a moment, Zhu Qiming roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, you might be unbeatable in the thirteen universe, but you’re nothing in the Zhu Lan Land! With your 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, the old ancestor of my family will kill you wish a single finger!” </p>
			<p> “Are you so sure of it?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’ll bring you to your old ancestor in a bit.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he threw them both back into the Sun Moon Furnace. </p>
			<p> “Lord, shall we head to the Jian Family or the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire?” Yu Xiaohong asked. </p>
			<p> “If we head over to the Jian Family, we should pass by your territory, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Yes…” Yu Xiaohong was slightly taken aback when she heard the question. Bowing respectfully, she explained, “My celestial empire isn’t located too far away from the Jian Family. We’ll probably need to travel for ten days in order to arrive at the Jian Family from my palace…” </p>
			<p> “Alright. We’ll head over to your place for a short rest.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Yes…” Yu Xiaohong was stunned for a moment, but a brilliant smile soon formed on her face. “It’s my honor.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen and the others felt a wave of envy rising in their hearts. </p>
			<p> After more than a month, Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. When they arrived at the border, Huang Xiaolong kept his Universe Boat and they flew over casually. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for them to arrive.  </p>
			<p> “Your celestial empire is pretty amazing…” Huang Xiaolong sighed when they entered. The atmosphere in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire was much better compared to the various empires they passed along the way. </p>
			<p> “Lord is too kind.” Yu Xiaohong chuckled. </p>
			<p> After entering the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, all of them strolled about however they liked. After half a month, they finally arrived in the Xiaohong City. </p>
			<p> The city was comparable to the Limitless City back in the Limitless Land. </p>
			<p> However, all of them noticed something strange when they entered the city. There were members of the Jian Family everywhere they went. </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong was naturally able to feel the difference in the air and a frown formed on her face. </p>
			<p> “I’ve heard that our celestial empire is about to form an alliance with Jian Wushuang! I wonder if it’s true…” Someone on the street asked. </p>
			<p> “It’s probably true. However, instead of an alliance, it’s better to say that our celestial empire is about to submit to the Jian Family!” </p>
			<p> “The Jian Family is extremely strong now, and our old ancestor has been missing for some time. It’s said that she’s trapped in the Bewilderment Forest, and she will probably lose her life eventually. It’s nothing strange for the celestial empire to submit to Jian Wushuang…” </p>
			<p> With her expression turning extremely unpleasant, Yu Xiaohong grabbed the man who spoke and snapped at him, “What did you just say?! My celestial empire is going to submit to the Jian Family?!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3635 – Where’s Mine?&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The experts she dragged over were peak-level Dao Venerables. They might be important figures in the region, but in front of a God of Creation with more than 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, they were barely specks of dust. Facing her face, they felt their souls leaving their bodies. </p>
			<p> With their lips trembling, the experts of the various families didn’t dare to utter a word. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but roar with laughter, “How are they going to reply you when you scare them like that?!” </p>
			<p> Retrieving her aura completely, an embarrassed smile formed on her face. In front of Huang Xiaolong, she became a demure young lady. With her breathtaking appearance to back her up, the atmosphere changed immediately. </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong created the celestial empire, but the celestial emperor wasn’t related to her by blood. He was a foster son she took in. Since the start of time, she hadn’t found a dao partner. </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen and the others looked at Yu Xiaohong and weird looks formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “Alright, all of us wish to know about the recent happenings in the celestial empire. Please tell us all you know.” Huang Xiaolong addressed the Dao Venerables Yu Xiaohong dragged over. “Of course, we’ll give you something for your troubles.” </p>
			<p> After speaking, he tossed over a bottle of pills. </p>
			<p> “Creation… Creation level pills!” One of them gasped after opening the bottle  </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered and he asked about the matters regarding the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> They replied respectfully, without any intentions of hiding a thing. Since he could take out creation pills like they were nothing, they didn’t dare to offend someone at his level. </p>
			<p> After asking about it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother them. He left with Yu Xiaohong and the others after learning what he wanted to know. </p>
			<p> The few of them only straightened their backs when Huang Xiaolong’s party left. </p>
			<p> They couldn’t regain their calm even after a long time. </p>
			<p> “Don’t… Don’t tell me… Are they all God of Creation Realm experts?!” Someone stammered. </p>
			<p> “There’s no way! Whatever the case, I can confirm that someone in that group isn’t a God of Creation.” </p>
			<p> It was true. Tao Hang was a Dao Venerable weaker than them and they could easily feel his level of cultivation. </p>
			<p> “That woman… She seems to be the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!” Someone gasped in fright all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Silence filled the lands. </p>
			<p> “This… There’s no way…” Someone muttered in surprise. “Is that really Lord Yu Xiaohong?! Didn’t they say that she was trapped in the Bewilderment Island?! Everyone knows that! Even if Lord Zhu Chen makes a move, he might not be able to save her! If she really is the lord ancestor, why would she be that youngster’s subordinate?!” </p>
			<p> “That’s true…” </p>
			<p> “My eyelids can’t stop jumping… Seems like something huge is going to happen.” 𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After they left, Yu Xiaohong’s expression was extremely unsightly. </p>
			<p> No one would feel great when they learned that the faction they created was going to submit to someone else!  </p>
			<p> They were betraying her in broad daylight! </p>
			<p> Moreover, the person who betrayed her was her foster son! She gave him the best resources before she entered the Bewilderment Island, and she would personally look for treasures when he broke through in the past! After so many years, she didn’t expect him to throw himself under another banner! </p>
			<p> “That’s his true nature…” Huang Xiaolong sighed. </p>
			<p> “I was blind to treat him so well!” Yu Xiaohong paused for a second before she cotninued, “I need to get to the bottom of this! If he’s really going to submit to Jian Wushuang, I’ll personally clean out my celestial empire of the filth that has accumulated.” </p>

			<p> Tao Hang looked at Yu Xiaohong and suddenly thought of Tao Han’er. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er was his foster daughter, but she turned into the princess of the Jian Family in the blink of an eye. He was a mere Dao Venerable of a small family! He was worried that she would turn her back on him when they met. </p>
			<p> Complicated emotions filled his heart. </p>
			<p> The group eventually made their way over to the imperial palace. </p>
			<p> Just as they were about to head into the palace, Yu Dawei, the Xiaohong Celestial Emperor, was tasting a Purple Ice and Fire Dragonfruit in the main hall. </p>
			<p> The fruit could only be obtained in the Purple Ice Valley in the region, and it contained the mysteries of the universe. One would benefit immensely if they consumed it often. </p>
			<p> The crown prince of the celestial empire, Yu Bo, entered the hall all of a sudden and joked, “Imperial Father, the Jian Family sent over the sword pills their old ancestor personally refined. There is also a sword manual written by Jian Wushuang!” </p>
			<p> He soon handed over a box and a bottle. </p>
			<p> With his eyes lighting up, Yu Dawei retrieved the items. His gaze was burning and he yelled in joy, “The members of the Jian Family kept their promise! Jian Wushuang’s sword dao is definitely recorded in the manual. As long as I manage to comprehend the mysteries behind the manual, my grand cosmos energy will transform just like his did! I’ll definitely be able to break through the 10 billion mark!” </p>
			<p> The items were the terms behind his agreement to submit to the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> As for the sword pill, he would be able to cultivate in the way of the sword manual easily.  </p>
			<p> Yu Bo looked at his father and he started to hesitate. “Imperial Father, what if the old ancestor returns? Wouldn’t she be unhappy that we submitted to the Jian Family?” </p>
			<p> That was something he was worried about since the start of their plan. </p>
			<p> Waving his son off, Yu Dawei explained, “Do you really think that that old hag will be able to make it out of the Bewilderment Island? The Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race barely made it out after working with each other. She will never be able to escape!” </p>
			<p> “Moreover, the Jian Family is our backer now! Jian Wushuang is the sixth supreme overlord in the Unknown Space, and she wouldn’t dare to touch us now that we’re under his banner!” </p>
			<p> Yu Bo sighed, “Imperial Father is right… Now that we chose to submit to the Jian Family, it’s a matter of time before the rise of our celestial empire!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! The envoys of the Jian Family will arrive tomorrow to secure our alliance. Get rid of everyone who tries to sabotage our union! Throw them all into prison! I won’t allow anyone to disrupt my plans!” </p>
			<p> “Imperial Father, rest assured that everything will run smoothly.” </p>
			<p> “I’ll be more than happy to hand it over to you. Relax. After we secure our place in the Jian Family, I will definitely reward you heavily!” </p>
			<p> Before Yu Bo could leave, a sharp voice rang through the air. “Where’s my share? Aren’t you guys going to get some goodies from the Jian Family?” </p>
			<p> Yu Dawei and Yu Bo felt a bomb going off in their heads when they heard the familiar voice. Panic flashed through their eyes.</p>

			</title>
			<p> They turned to the entrance of the main hall instantly. </p>
			<p> They saw a massive group of people entering the hall without the slightest resistance! The protective formation around the hall didn’t seem to exist! </p>
			<p> Yu Dawei looked at the beauty among the group. </p>
			<p> “Ances… Ancestor…” </p>
			<p> They couldn’t believe their eyes. Wasn’t she said to be trapped in the Bewilderment Island?! How did she escape?! </p>
			<p> “What’s wrong? Are you disappointed that I managed to emerge from the Bewilderment Island?” Yu Xiaohong sneered when she saw the look on their faces. </p>
			<p> “No… We’re just surprised that you managed to return!” Yu Dawei stuttered. “We’re extremely happy now that you’re back!” </p>
			<p> Yu Bo stepped forward and got to his knees. “We congratulate lord ancestor on your safe return!” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong glanced at him casually before turning to look at the manual and pill in Yu Dawei’s hand.  </p>
			<p> “Are these the gifts from the Jian Family?” Yu Xiaohong snorted. “Jian Wushuang is really generous. In order to get you guys to surrender, he’s willing to bring out his sword manual…” </p>
			<p> “Ancestor, you’re mistaken! Lord Jian Wushuang gave them to me as he admires my talent! He’s planning to give me some pointers. That’s all there is!” Yu Dawei explained hastily. </p>
			<p> “Oh? From what you’re saying, you don’t plan to surrender to the Jian Family.” Yu Xiaohong snorted. </p>
			<p> Frowning, Yu Dawei gritted his teeth and he eventually spat, “That… That is true. You know what, I am already someone from the Jian Family! Yu Xiaohong, do you really think that you can do anything to me now that I’m part of them? Are you not afraid that Lord Jian Wushuang will deal with you? You might not know this since you just emerged from the Bewilderment Island, but Lord Jian Wushuang has already become the sixth supreme overlord in the Unknown Space!” </p>
			<p> “He’s of the same status as Lord Zhu Chen!” </p>
			<p> Yu Dawei roared haughtily. It was as though Jian Wushuang’s glory belonged to himself! </p>
			<p> “Jian Wushuang? Sixth supreme overlord? That might not be the case…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled at the side. </p>
			<p> Hearing a random youngster show his disrespect for Jian Wushuang, Yu Dawei snorted in anger, “Which rock did you crawl out from? Are you stupid? Get out of my sight, you fool!” </p>
			<p> However, Yu Xiaohong sent him flying with a single slap as soon as he insulted Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Preposterous!” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong’s slap sent Yu Dawei flying into one of the walls in the hall. </p>
			<p> She didn’t hold back much when slapping Yu Dawei. As such, blood streamed down his cheeks and there was a red palm print imprinted on his face. </p>
			<p> Yu Bo who was still kneeling on the ground felt a wave of weakness in his legs. </p>
			<p> When Yu Dawei finally crawled to his feet, he cleaned the blood off his cheeks and he sneered, “Old b*tch, is he a gigolo you found on your travels?! Are you crazy?! If you cripple me, Lord Jian Wushuang will fly into a rage! When that happens, you’ll be dead! This gigolo of yours will meet a miserable end!” </p>
			<p> Killing intent filled her heart when she heard what he said. Glaring at Yu Dawei, she sneered, “Since that’s what you think, I’ll cripple you now!” </p>
			<p> She circulated the grand cosmos energy in her body and a burst of golden light emerged from her palm as she slammed it into his chest. </p>
			<p> Even though Yu Dawei was a half step Universe God, he hasn’t broken through the 10 billion mark! He was no match for her! </p>
			<p> In an instant, his dao heart was shattered and his meridians broke into tiny little pieces. </p>
			<p> Of course, she didn’t manage to shatter his physical body with a single strike. After all, the man was a half step Universe God and he was wearing a top-grade creation artifact level armor. His fleshy body was strong beyond belief. If the person who took the strike was an ordinary God of Creation at the grand completion level, they would have been turned into meat paste! </p>
			<p> Yu Dawei stared at her in confusion as he didn’t believe that she had the guts to actually cripple him. </p>
			<p> “Yu Xiaohong, why are you going so far for a mere gigolo?!” A sinister expression formed on his face and he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong. The sword in his hand moved quickly as it slashed towards Huang Xiaolong’s neck. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might have been crippled by Yu Xiaohong’s strike, but he only experienced a massive drop in strength. He could still use whatever grand cosmos energy he accumulated in the past. </p>
			<p> As they were pretty close to each other, Yu Dawei appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye. Ordinary God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage would never be able to hold off his attack. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong held the tip of Yu Dawei’s sword with his fingers. </p>
			<p> Even though the tip of the sword was a mere inch away from Huang Xiaolong’s eye, it couldn’t budge any further. </p>
			<p> Pinching his fingers together, Yu Dawei’s sword started to ring. Waving his hand, the sword in Yu Dawei’s hand turned into a streak of light that turned around to pierce through his forehead. With the sword sticking through his head, he was pinned to the wall on the far end of the hall. </p>
			<p> “You can deal with him.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yu Xiaohong. </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord.” </p>
			<p> Yu Bo and Yu Dawei couldn’t believe what they just heard. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Yu Xiaohong approached Yu Dawei. </p>
			<p> When he felt the killing intent rolling off her, desperation filled his heart and he started to plead with her, “Mother, I was wrong! I… I… Please, spare me this time! I was forced by the Jian Family to do everything I did! If I refuse to submit, they’ll exterminate the celestial empire! </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that I’m stupid? In order to break through the bottle neck of 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, you agreed to be Jian Wushuang’s slave! How dare you spin it another way?! In the past, I saved you out of the kindness of my heart! You were beaten half to death and I was the one who gave you all the resources you needed to reach your level today! Today, I’ll take back everything I gave you!” Yu Xiaohong sneered. </p>
			<p> “Yu Xiaohong, if you dare to cripple me, Lord Jian Wushuang will never let you off!” Yu Dawei realized that there was no going back. </p>
			<p> The moment the words left his lips, Yu Xiaohong waved her sword in the air and a million rays of sword light landed on Yu Dawei’s body. </p>
			<p> A miserable shriek rang through the hall. </p>
			<p> “Mercy!” </p>
			<p> “Ancestor, please spare my father’s life!” </p>
			<p> Yu Bo pleaded with her endlessly. </p>
			<p> However, Yu Xiaohong turned her sword the other way and Yu Bo was no longer able to speak. He would remain silent till the end of time.  </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> The very next day, Yu Xiaohong carried out a cleansing in her celestial empire. </p>
			<p> In the inner hall of one of the manors in the city, Jian Xiyuan, an eminent elder of the Jian Family, frowned, “What?! Yu Xiaohong actually returned?!” 𝘧𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> The news couldn’t be kept for long as Yu Xiaohong basically carried out a massacre in the celestial empire. The news of her return quickly reached the ears of those who were concerned. </p>
			<p> “Yes… I heard that she crippled Yu Dawei the day she returned.” A grand elder of the Jian Family hesitated a moment before explaining. </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan’s expression sank when he heard the news. He was the envoy from the Jian Family and he received an order from the patriarch of the Jian Family to negotiate the terms of alliance with the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. They were about to finalize the details, but who would have thought that Yu Xiaohong would return the day before it happened?! </p>
			<p> In order to express their sincerity, they had already given Jian Wushuang’s sword manual and sword pill to Yu Dawei! </p>
			<p> “Does she have our items?” Jian Xiyuan growled. </p>
			<p> “Yes…” </p>
			<p> “She knew that Yu Dawei was about to surrender to our Jian Family, but she went ahead and crippled him! She obviously doesn’t care about our Jian Family!” A cold light flashed through his eyes. “Alright. Let’s meet Yu Xiaohong and ask her what’s going on.”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3637 – Guns Blazing&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The grand elder who was together with the eminent elder couldn’t help but stutter when he heard that they were going to look for Yu Xiaohong. “But… But… Her strength…” </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan might be an eminent elder of the Jian Family and his strength might be second only to the patriarch. However, he barely had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy! He was far too lacking when compared to Yu Xiaohong. </p>
			<p> A sneer left Jian Xiyuan’s lips, “So what?! Do you think she will dare to move against me?” </p>
			<p> The grand elder lowered his head and muttered, “Even though she might not dare to, but we should really be careful…” </p>
			<p> “If Yu Xiaohong dares to do anything to us, she’ll be in for a lot of trouble! This dumb b*tch dares to reject our patriarch… She really doesn’t know what’s good for her.” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong was a devastating beauty. With her relationship status and strength, she was the ideal partner for many supreme experts! The patriarch of the Jian Family, Jian Weifeng, was one of her many suitors! </p>
			<p> In the past, he tried all sorts of things to chase her. He even tried proposing twice! Even so, he was rejected all the time. </p>
			<p> The matter of his rejection spread throughout the Zhu Lan Land. With Jian Weifeng’s strength and status, he was like a god in the Zhu Lan Land! She was a perfect match for him, but because of the rejections, he turned into a laughing stock in the region! 𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> “Should we report this to the patriarch?” The grand elder asked.  </p>
			<p> Nodding slowly, Jian Xiyuan sighed, “That’s actually a good idea.” Taking out his transmission symbol, he made a report to the patriarch. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for him to receive a reply. </p>
			<p> A smile formed on Jian Xiyuan’s face when he read the reply. “The patriarch has spoken! Because of her disrespect to lord ancestor, she will have to return all our gifts. In addition, she will have to take out twenty universe-level spiritual veins as compensation!” </p>
			<p> The grand elder stared at Jian Xiyuan in shock. </p>
			<p> However, he soon realized the patriarch’s intentions. </p>
			<p> He was forcing her into a corner! </p>
			<p> After getting rejected twice, Jian Weifeng formed a grudge against Yu Xiaohong! </p>
			<p> “Let’s go! We’ll look for her now!” Jian Xiyuan harrumphed. After getting the reply from the patriarch, Jian Xiyuan felt extremely confident in himself. </p>
			<p> As such, he brought along the experts of the Jian Family and they quickly made their way towards the imperial palace. </p>
			<p> When they were making their way over, Huang Xiaolong was casually flipping through the sword manual. There were a hundred pages in total and there was an image of a sword on every one of them. While Huang Xiaolong flipped through the pages, Yu Xiaohong and the others standing beside him said, “Jian Wushiang’s sword dao is unparalleled in the Unknown Space. His comprehension of the sword dao has already reached the peak.” </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen continued, “It’s true that Jian Wushuang’s sword dao has reached the peak, but he’s nothing compared to our lord!” </p>
			<p> Lu Liang, another half step Universe God, laughed, “Brother Zheng Shen is right. Jian Wushuang is far too weak compared to our lord.” </p>
			<p> “You guys are full of sh*t…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> A sheepish look appeared on Zheng Shen and Lu Liang’s face, but a mischievous light flashed through their eyes. </p>
			<p> In fact, they weren’t trying to exaggerate the facts. It was true that no matter how profound Jian Wushuang’s sword dao was, he wouldn’t be able to beat Huang Xiaolong even if he gave it his all! </p>
			<p> Strength was everything. Techniques and sword dao might matter in a battle between experts of comparable strength, but when one party was overwhelmingly powerful, there would be no doubts about the resulting battle.  </p>
			<p> If Jian Wushuang’s combat abilities reached the 23 billion units mark, he might be able to put up a fight with his sword dao. However, Jian Wushuang was far from that. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong then retrieved the sword pills. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong could feel the sword intent coming from the pills. However, the sword intent in the pills weren’t beneficial to the person who took it. After consuming it, their dao souls would be controlled by Jian Wushuang’s sword intent. </p>
			<p> Summoning his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong quickly inspected the sword pills. A sneer formed on his lips. Jian Wushuang branded the pills with his soul. No one weaker than Jian Wushuang would be able to discover the abnormality behind the pills. Too bad for him, Huang Xiaolong was the one playing with the pills. </p>
			<p> “Jian Wushuang branded his soul in them.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> “Who would have thought that he would resort to such means…” Yu Xiaohong frowned. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t care as he tossed both pills into his mouth. </p>
			<p> Everyone stared at him, dumbfounded. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at [ FreeWebNovel.com ]. </p>
			<p> “Lord, you…” </p>
			<p> “I’m fine… The pills might be able to control Yu Dawei, but they’re useless against me.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> Even though Jian Wushuang’s sword dao was unparalleled, there was no way he could control Huang Xiaolong with his means. </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls, Jian Wushuang could unleash his sword intent in front of Huang Xiaolong without Huang Xiaolong taking up any precautions and he wouldn’t be able to tear through the man’s defenses. </p>
			<p> The moment Huang Xiaolong swallowed the pills, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes in the palace of the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> “Father, this…” Jian Wufeng asked. </p>
			<p> “Someone refined both sword pills…”  </p>
			<p> Jian Wufeng was slightly taken aback. “Could Yu Xiaohong have swallowed the pills the moment she got her hands on them? Is she planning to comprehend the sword dao with the help of the pills?” </p>
			<p> “That seems to be the case.” Jian Wushuang nodded. </p>
			<p> A look of joy flashed through Jian Wufeng’s face. “If that’s true, lord father will be able to control her! Wouldn’t that mean…” A sinister smile formed on his face when he thought of the possibilities. </p>
			<p> Jian Wushuang chuckled, “My soul brand will slowly affect her dao soul now that she swallowed the pills. However, we’ll need several more years for the effects to show.” </p>
			<p> “It’s just several years…” Jian Wufeng laughed. </p>
			<p> He could already envision Yu Xiaohong turning into his obedient plaything in a few years. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After swallowing the pills, Huang Xiaolong felt much greater affinity towards the sword dao. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, someone entered the main hall to make a report. “Lord Ancestor, Eminent Elder Jian Xiyuan of the Jian Family has arrived! He wishes to meet you! He brought along several dozen experts of the Jian Family, and they don’t seem to be here with good intentions!” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong glanced at Huang Xiaolong as she wanted to see his intentions.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3638 – Forgetting Past Relations&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Let them in. Let’s see how fierce they can be…” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong and the others laughed in response. That was true. Even if Jian Wushuang personally came, he wouldn’t be able to leave the hall unscathed! </p>
			<p> Turning to the general who entered the hall, Yu Xiaohong ordered, “You heard the Lord! Bring Jian Xiyuan in!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord Ancestor!” The general replied before turning around to call for the members of the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> “Head over to the main hall. I won’t be meeting him.” Huang Xiaolong lagged. He turned to the sword manual and he said, “This looks pretty interesting. I’ll continue to look into it.” </p>
			<p> Bowing respectfully, Yu Xiaohong headed for the main hall. </p>
			<p> After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong decided to send Zheng Shen and the others over to the main hall with Yu Xiaohong. After all, Jian Xiyuan brought several dozen experts with him. She might be able to suppress them alone, but Huang Xiaolong felt that they had to keep up with appearances. Since the other party brought more men, they would also show off their manpower! </p>
			<p> After they left, Huang Xiaolong continued to flip through the sword manual. Unknowingly, he reached the eighth page. </p>
			<p> If Jian Wushuang was present, he would probably smash his head into the wall after noticing Huang Xiaolong’s speed. Every single page contained profound sword dao that he comprehended after a long time! Even half step Universe Gods with terrifying talent would take several years to comprehend a single page!  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was a monster! </p>
			<p> As he continued to read through the manual, the general who made the report spoke to Jian Xiyuan and the others. </p>
			<p> “Lord Ancestor has summoned you.” </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan’s expression sank and he sneered, “Who does she think she is? I came all the way here only for her to send a lowly general like yourself oer. Didn’t you tell her that I wanted her to personally come out to welcome me?” </p>
			<p> “I am merely here to convey the ancestor’s orders.” The general said calmly. </p>
			<p> “Preposterous!” Another eminent elder of the Jian Family, Jian Chengfeng, raged and sent the general flying with a single slap. When he landed on the ground, his head had swelled to the size of a pig’s. </p>
			<p> A quick look at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that I won’t cripple you right here and now?” Jian Chengfeng roared. </p>
			<p> However, he was stopped by Jian Xiyuan. “Enough. He’s a general of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. You can’t kill him here. Just slap him a couple of times and send him away.” </p>
			<p> Slapping the general until all the teeth were beaten out of his mouth, Jian Chengfeng finally sent him away. </p>
			<p> The general was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. He was no match for Jian Chengfeng who was at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> When Jian Chengfeng finally stopped, he snapped at the general, “Bring us in right now or I’ll behead you!” </p>
			<p> The general didn’t utter a word of resentment and he merely muttered, “You guys will regret this.” </p>
			<p> “Humph. Do you really think that Yu Xiaohong will do anything to us because of you? Even if we cripple you here, she wouldn’t dare to touch a single hair on our heads!” </p>
			<p> “Why aren’t you leading us in?!” </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan kicked the general, causing him to fly into the hall. He was in an extremely sorry state after all the abuse by the members of the Jian Family.  </p>
			<p> When they saw his pitiful figure crawling to his feet, the members of the Jian Family roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> Swallowing his grievances, the general led them into the main hall. </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan sneered as he walked behind the man. “Look at all of you. You’re all losers! Your celestial emperor was nothing but a lowly slave, and your ancestor’s a b*tch! Hahaha! You’re so much worse than them! You don’t even dare to look at us after we beat you up! Hahaha!” </p>
			<p> Soon after, they arrived in the main hall. </p>
			<p> “Please wait a moment while I report to the ancestor.” The general said. </p>
			<p> “Bullsh*t! What do you have to report? F*ck off!” Jian Xiyuan kicked the general aside before strolling into the main hall. </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong noticed everything that went on outside and her expression sank instantly. “Jian Xiyuan, you’re going too far!” </p>
			<p> She released her aura completely. </p>
			<p> Even though Jian Xiyuan could feel the pressure coming off her, he snorted in response, “Yu Xiaohong, Yu Dawei was one of us after he surrendered to the Jian Family. How dare you cripple him? Whatever the case, hand over our sword manual and sword pills. You will also have to compensate us with twenty top-grade universe-level spiritual veins!” </p>
			<p> “Nonsense! What if I refuse?” Yu Xiaohong sneered. </p>
			<p> “If you refuse, you can’t blame our patriarch for forgetting his past relationship with you!” </p>
			<p> “Humph. I’ll tell you right now. I won’t hand over a single item over to you!” Yu Xiaohong snorted in contempt. </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan and the members of the Jian Family stared at her in shock. </p>
			<p> They didn’t expect her to be so adamant about it. </p>
			<p> “Yu Ming, how many times did they slap you?” Yu Xiaohong turned to ask the general. </p>
			<p> “Jian Chengfeng slapped me a total of eight times.” Turning to point at Jian Xiyuan, he continued, “Including the kick outside the hall, Jian Xiyuan kicked me twice.” 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝓂 </p>
			<p> Jian Chengfeng laughed in amusement when he heard what the general said. “Yu Xiaohong, are you really thinking of taking revenge for your subordinates? Don’t forget, our ancestor is the sixth supreme overlord of the Unknown Space!” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong ignored his threats and muttered, “Since you slapped him eight times, I’ll slap you eighteen times!” As soon as she spoke, she appeared before Jian Chengfeng. </p>
			<p> He couldn’t react in time as eight slaps landed on his face immediately. </p>
			<p> By the time she was done, he was sent flying out of the hall. </p>
			<p> “It’s your turn!” Yu Xiaohong looked at Jian Xiyuan. </p>
			<p> “Yu Xiaohong, how dare you! Lay down the sword formation immediately!” As soon as he spoke, sword intent filled the hall. The experts of the Jian Family spring into action. </p>
			<p> However, they couldn’t even do a thing as more than thirty experts on Yu Xiaohong’s side appeared to suppress the members of the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen and the others weren’t there for show… </p>
			<p> When Jian Xiyuan was still stuck in a state of shock, he was sent flying with a single kick from Yu Xiaohong. </p>
			<p> “Yu Xiaohong, you sl*t!” He barely crawled to his feet before he was sent flying by another kick from Yu Xiaohong.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3639 – Are You Afraid I’ll Cripple Him&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong didn’t hold back and her second kick caused Jian Xiyuan’s spine to snap. </p>
			<p> Initially, Jian Xiyuan was an expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He would be able to put up a fight against Yu Xiaohong, but he was careless! He didn’t think that she would move against him with the threat of Jian Wushuang hovering over her head! </p>
			<p> Yi Xiaohong didn’t stop there. She appeared before Jian Xiyuan before slapping him heavily. When her palm landed on Jian Xiyuan’s face, he flew out once again. </p>
			<p> “That’s for your foul mouth.” </p>
			<p> Struggling to get to his feet, Jian Xiyuan’s gaze was cold as killing intent raged in his eyes. He glared at Yu Xiaohong and he roared, “Yu Xiaohong, you bitc…” He was about to finish his word when he saw the cold gaze in her eyes. Swallowing his words, he changed the topic immediately. “We’ll report this to our patriarch! He will definitely tell our ancestor about this incident!” </p>
			<p> “When that happens, our Lord Ancestor will pay a visit to your celestial empire personally!” </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong couldn’t be more calm and she sighed, “Go back and tell Jian Wufeng and Jian Wushuang that there’s no need for them to come over. We’ll head over to your Jian Family in a short while.” </p>
			<p> Taken slightly aback, Jian Xiyuan stuttered, “Fine… Fine! We’ll do just that!” Looking at Zheng Shen and the others, he quickly backed away. </p>
			<p> “We’re leaving!”  </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen and the others didn’t make things difficult for the members of the Jian Family and they allowed them to leave. </p>
			<p> After Jian Xiyuan and the others were gone, Yu Xiaohong returned to the courtyard in the palace and made a report to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly and muttered, “Alright. You can take your leave for now.” </p>
			<p> Everyone quickly left his courtyard. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong chuckled to himself. He planned to visit Tao Han’er on his trip, but who would have thought that the Jian Family would mess with them before they even arrived? </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Jian Xiyuan and the others left the city in a sorry state. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “Lord Xiyuan, how dare that sl*t attack us?!” Jian Chengfeng couldn’t contain the rage in his heart and he roared in anger. He couldn’t take the slaps lying down! </p>
			<p> Killing intent filled Jian Xiyuan’s eyes and he continued, “That b*tch crippled Yu Dawei and attacked us… She even said that she would pay a visit to the Lord Ancestor. Seems like she’s tired of living! I’ll make a report to the patriarch right now!” </p>
			<p> Jian Wufeng soon received a report. </p>
			<p> He stared at the report in shock. </p>
			<p> “What?! She’s not willing to hand over the spiritual veins?!” Jian Wushuang frowned and he looked at his son. “Well, that’s nothing special. She wouldn’t be able to find them in the span of a day anyway.” </p>
			<p> Jian Wufeng hesitated for a moment and continued, “Jian Xiyuan also said that she wouldn’t return us any of our treasures.” </p>
			<p> “Oh?!” Jian Wushuang frowned and he was stunned by the news. </p>
			<p> “Did she really say that or is Xiyuan talking nonsense? Is she really not planning on returning my sword manual?” Jian Wushuang asked again. He could understand the reason behind Yu Xiaohong’s actions of crippling Yu Dawei. However, he couldn’t believe the fact that she would lust over the treasures of the Jian Family.  </p>
			<p> “That was what Xiyuan said in his report.” Jian Wufeng said. “He wouldn’t lie to me. Moreover, she kicked him twice, causing his spine to snap! She also slapped Jian Chengfeng eighteen times!” </p>
			<p> “What?!” Unable to contain his surprise, Jian Wushuang allowed a small part of his sword intent to leak. The city trembled. </p>
			<p> Not a single person missed the sword intent that came from the Jian Family Manor, and they stopped what they were doing. </p>
			<p> “Give me the report.” </p>
			<p> Jian Wufeng didn’t dare to dally in the slightest as he passed the report over to his father. </p>
			<p> He read the report word by word as the frosty expression on his face grew stronger. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Jian Wufeng spoke after Jian Wushuang had retracted his aura. “Father, the ceremony is about to begin. We can always look for her after the ceremony ends. After all, she has already refined the sword pills. That might be the reason behind her reluctance to return our treasures.” </p>
			<p> “Since she swallowed the pills, she will eventually belong to us in a few years. We can do whatever we like to her then!” </p>
			<p> Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Wufeng quietly and the latter eventually lowered his head. </p>
			<p> “Are you afraid that I’ll cripple her? It’s been so many years… Are you still not over her?” Jian Wushuang sighed. </p>
			<p> Jian Wufeng didn’t dare to say a word. He was a God of Creation with more than 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Even so, he was like a little kid before Jian Wushuang. 𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝒏𝙤𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p> “Relax… Since you love her so much, I won’t cripple her. However, I won’t let her off easily after she injured the eminent elders of my Jian Family!” </p>
			<p> “Many thanks to Lord Father!” Jian Wufeng thanked profusely. </p>
			<p> Several days passed in a flash. </p>
			<p> Everything that happened in the imperial palace of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire caused a storm to spread in the Zhu Lan Land. </p>
			<p> In the days that passed, Huang Xiaolong cooped himself up in his courtyard to read the sword manual written by Jian Wushuang and he had no idea what happened in the outside world.  </p>
			<p> With his speed, he reached the eighteenth page in a few short days. As the pages at the back were harder to understand, his speed slowed down considerably. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s respect for Jian Wushuang grew as he continued to read the manual. He had to admit that he was far from Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the sword dao. </p>
			<p> One fine day, Yu Xiaohong and the others came over to find him. </p>
			<p> “Lord, there’s something we wish to report.” Yu Xiaohong didn’t dare to speak loudly in case she distracted him from his comprehension. </p>
			<p> “Speak.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes didn’t leave the sword manual and he spoke. </p>
			<p> “We heard that the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce will be selling a batch of universe-level spiritual veins in a few days.” </p>
			<p> “Oh? Them again?” Huang Xiaolong snapped the manual shut. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. There seems to be two hundred spiritual veins in the batch they are planning to auction off. There are several top-grade universe-level spiritual veins among them.” Yu Xiaohong explained. She knew that Huang Xiaolong urgently needed them. </p>
			<p> “That’s a lot…” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. </p>
			<p> Zheng Shen laughed all of a sudden, “I heard that the oldest son of the patriarch of the Jian Family will be attending along with Young Lady Tao Han’er. Right… Mei Jie’s son might also be there!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3640 – Mei Jie’s Son&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Mei Jie’s son?!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned. </p>
			<p> He asked them to take note of matters regarding the Zhu Family and Mei Jie, but he didn’t expect them to be so efficient. </p>
			<p> It had only been several million years, and Mei Jie got himself a son! </p>
			<p> “Yes… Mei Jie’s son.” Zheng Shen continued, “We also learned that Mei Jie got married to Zhu Xinyi after he went to the Zhu Family. Their son is called Zhu Jian.” </p>
			<p> “Zhu Jian?!” Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted. Wouldn’t that mean that Mei Jie had married into the Zhu Family?! What the f… </p>
			<p> Yu Xiaohong continued, “Zhu Jian has exceptional talent. He inherited supreme bloodlines from both Mei Jie and the Zhu Family. He has already reached the high-level Dao Venerable Realm after several million years of cultivation! Moreover, Mei Jie broke through to the peak of the grand completion stage. He’s the second strongest experty after Zhu Chen now! From what it seems, he’s as important as Zhu Ji in the Zhu Family!” </p>
			<p> “Mei Jie, Zhu Xinyi, Zhu Jian…” Huang Xiaolong slowly got to his feet. After some time, a smile formed on his face and he asked, “When will the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce be auctioning off the items?” </p>
			<p> “Three days later.” Yu Xiaohong replied. </p>
			<p> Find the original at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;.  </p>
			<p> Next, he asked about several matters regarding the auction. </p>
			<p> “Alright, all of you can return now.” Huang Xiaolong said after he learned what he wanted to know. Picking up the sword manual, he sent them away. </p>
			<p> At dawn the very next day, Yu Xiaohong handed over an invitation to the auction. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong brought Tao Hang along with him and they quickly left for the auction. </p>
			<p> The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce chose to hold their auction in the Stoneless Celestial Empire, and it was pretty close to the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. Even so, that was relative to Huang Xiaolong. He needed a single day to arrive and he chose to leave Yu Xiaohong and the others behind. Whatever the case, she needed to deal with matters regarding the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> There were several God of Creation Realm experts who were familiar with the area in the group on board the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> When they finally arrived, the entire venue had already been prepared. The Stoneless Celestial Empire might be weaker than the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, but their ancestor was a half step Universe God. He was quite the figure in the Zhu Lan Land and his celestial empire wasn’t too shabby. </p>
			<p> “Lord, should I look for a place to stay? After all, the auction is tomorrow.” Cao Dehong asked. He was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, and his Cao Family was located in the Stoneless City. </p>
			<p> “Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. </p>
			<p> A look of joy formed on his face when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s response. He quickly led the way over to his residence. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong arrived, he noticed that the Cao Family seemed to be celebrating something. The decorations weren't there to welcome Cao Dehong. When he asked around, he realized that the patriarch of the Cao Family, Cao Kezhang, was preparing to welcome a very important guest! </p>
			<p> They were going to play host to Zhu Jian! </p>
			<p> With Mei Jie’s status in the Zhu Family, Zhu Jian’s importance in the Zhu Lan Land couldn’t be underestimated. </p>
			<p> When Cai Kezhang learned that Zhu Jian was going to attend the auction, he quickly spoke to the God of Creation Realm experts around Zhu Jian to invite him to stay in the Cao Family Manor for a single day. </p>
			<p> Who would have thought that Zhu Jian would agree?! </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang was so happy that almost personally went out to buy the decorations for the manor. </p>
			<p> The members of the Cao Family were waiting outside the manor to welcome Zhu Jian, but they were nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, several dozen figures appeared on the streets. Jumping with joy, Cao Kezhang yelled, “Young Master Zhu Jian is here!” </p>
			<p> The experts of the Cao Family quickly went up to the group. </p>
			<p> “Brother Zhu Yun!” Cao Kezhang noticed his friend the moment he went up. When he greeted everyone he knew, he turned to Zhu Jian and started kissing his ass. “Young Master Zhu Jian’s arrival brightens up my Cao Family Manor! I heard that Brother Zhu Jian likes the Mei Zi Wine, and I got my men to prepare them.” </p>
			<p> The wine was specially made by a half step Universe God called Mei Zi. Her strength was comparable to Yu Xiaohong and she was also a top beauty in the Unknown Space. A single jar would cost a billion dao coins, and one might not be able to buy it even if they had the money! In order to get a single jar, Cao Kezhang used quite a bit of effort. </p>
			<p> Casually glancing at Cao Kezhang, Zhu Jian asked, “How many jars did you manage to get?” </p>
			<p> An embarrassed expression appeared on his face and he stuttered, “This… Young Master Zhu Jian knows how precious the wine is. I only managed to get a single jar…” </p>
			<p> Before he could finish, he was interrupted. “Heh, I won’t even be able to fill the gaps of my teeth with a single jar. Do you really think that I’ll appreciate your gesture when you can only get a single jar of wine?” </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang’s expression changed and he explained hastily, “Young Master Zhu Jian, that’s not what I meant!” He quickly looked at Zhu Yun to ask for assistance.  </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun turned to Zhu Jian and muttered, “Young Master, it’s extremely difficult to get a single jar of Mei Zi Wine. Cao Kezhang is only trying to show his appreciation for you and there’s nothing to fuss over.” </p>
			<p> Ignoring Cao Kezhang, Zhu Lan entered the manor. However, a pretty lady in the crowd caught his eye when he was walking through the entrance. He turned to Cao Kezhang and sneered, “She shall pour my wine.” </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang’s expression sank slightly. The lady he pointed at was his daughter, Cao Ying. He would celebrate if his daughter caught Zhu Jian’s eye previously, but she was already engaged to the young master of the Chen Family in the Stoneless Celestial Empire. The reputation of the Cao Family would be dragged through the mud if they allowed her to serve another man. </p>
			<p> The Chen Family might not dare to do a thing to the Zhu Family, but they were more than capable of smashing the Cao Family to bits! It wasn’t as though Zhu Jian wanted her as his bride, and there was nothing in it for the Cao Family! </p>
			<p> Cao Ying’s expression changed when she heard what Zhu Jian said, </p>
			<p> Noticing Cao Kezhang’s face, Zhu Jian sneered, “What’s the problem? Are you not willing to let her do it?” </p>
			<p> Explaining in haste, Cao Kezhang tried to diffuse the situation. “No… No. That’s not it. Young Master Zhu Jian, she got engaged with the young master of the Chen Family several days ago. There are other beauties in my Cao Family, and I’ll get them to serve you!” </p>
			<p> A slap landed on Cao Kezhang’s face when Zhu Jian heard what he said. The resounding clap rang through the skies and it was followed by a snort from Zhu Jian. “What are you trying to say?! Do I look like a pervert to you?!” 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> “No… No…” </p>
			<p> “She’ll serve me later. That’s it.” Zhu Jian declared before walking into the manor.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3641 – My Grandfather is The Master of the Zhu Lan Lands!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Helpless, Cao Kezhang could only look towards Zhu Yun. </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun sneered in contempt, “Cao Kezhang, you brought this upon yourself. Our young master decided not to pursue the previous matter, but your daughter hasn’t entered the Chen Family yet. Aren’t you messing with us internationally?” </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang revealed a bitter expression and he sighed, ‘Brother Zhu Yun, don’t you know that the old ancestor of the Chen Family is a God of Creation at the large completion stage?” </p>
			<p> “Humph, a weakling like that isn’t worth a fart before my Zhu Family.” 𝒻𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝑛ℴ𝘷𝑒𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> “Yes… Yes…” Cao Kezhang muttered. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to worry. If the old ancestor of the Chen Family dares to take his rage out on you guys, let me know.” Zhu Jian muttered. “I’ll deal with it.” </p>
			<p> Now that Zhu Jian had spoken, Cao Kezhang couldn’t say anything else. Everyone could tell that Zhu Jian was at the end of his patience. If they angered him, the Cao Family would be done for! </p>
			<p> Naturally, Cao Kezhang knew that Zhu Jian was only stepping in to end the discussion. With his status, he wouldn’t bother with anything that happened after he left. The Cao Family would be left to deal with the Chen Family’s rage eventually. </p>
			<p> Walking towards Cao Ying, Zhu Jian caressed her face and he chuckled, “Not too bad. She’s a little beauty indeed. If your performance in the following days pleases me, I’ll treat you well.”  </p>
			<p> Cao Ying gritted her teeth and tears of despair streamed down her face. </p>
			<p> Everyone knew what Zhu Jian meant. Obviously, he didn’t expect her to bring him tea and wine in the following days. She would have to provide him with plenty of extra services on top of that! </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang and the experts of the Cao Family knew what was going to happen, but none of them dared to speak up! </p>
			<p> “Take your hands off her right now!” A cold sneer rang through the skies. </p>
			<p> Widening their eyes in shock, no one expected anyone to speak in that manner to Zhu Jian. </p>
			<p> Turning around slowly, Zhu Jian glared at the person who spoke. </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang and the experts of the Cao Family were pleasantly surprised by the appearance of the newcomer. </p>
			<p> “Ancestor!” </p>
			<p> “Father, you returned from the Bewilderment Island!” Cao Kezhang yelled happily as he rushed over to Cao Dehong. </p>
			<p> Other than Cao Dehong, there were five other people standing around him. They were Huang Xiaolong, Tao Hang, and the others! </p>
			<p> “Grandpa!” Cao Ying cried as she ran over to Cao Dehong. After all, her grandfather had always doted on her. </p>
			<p> Turning to face Cao Kezhang, Cao Dehong slapped him across the face. “You piece of sh*t, you embarrassed our entire family!” </p>
			<p> They had long seen Cao Kezhang’s cowardly actions from afar. They only appeared when Zhu Jian took things too far. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> After slapping Cao Kezhang, Cao Dehong hugged his granddaughter and sighed, “There’s no need to worry. Your father might not dare to stand up for you, but I will!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian sneered in response, “Standing up for her? Old man, are you the ancestor of the Cao Family? How do you wish to deal with this?” A look of mockery could be seen in his eyes. </p>
			<p> Even though he was surprised that Cao Dehong managed to return from the Bewilderment Island, he knew that Cao Dehong was a ‘mere’ God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. With the Zhu Family’s background, he wasn’t afraid of Cao Dehong in the slightest. </p>
			<p> As such, he didn’t really care that Cao Dehong had returned. </p>
			<p> Ignoring Huang Xiaolong and the others, he didn’t care how many people Cao Dehong came back with either. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong glanced at Huang Xiaolong subconsciously. Zhu Jian was Zhu Chen’s grandson, and he was also Mei Jie’s son! If Huang Xiaolong chose not to back him up, there was no way he could go against the entire Zhu Family. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong saw the look on Cao Dehong’s face, and he muttered softly, “Break whichever hand he used to touch her.” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord.” With Huang Xiaolong’s affirmation, Cao Dehong was no longer worried about angering the Zhu Family! He turned to Zhu Jian and a cold light flashed in his eyes. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian roared with laughter when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You motherf*cker, who do you think you are? Do you dare to say that again?” </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong didn’t bother waiting for Zhu Jian to finish as he shattered Zhu Jian’s arm before Huang Xiaolong could reply. </p>
			<p> As a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, one could only imagine the outcome when he wanted to teach the puny Zhu Jian a lesson. Miserable yells rang through the air. </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun and the experts of the Zhu Family didn’t expect Cao Dehong to move so suddenly, and their expression changed instantly. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Cao Family were similarly shocked. </p>
			<p> “Cao Dehong, you…” Zhu Yun roared as killing intent filled the air. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Zhu Family lunged at Cao Dehong in unison. </p>
			<p> However, three figures appeared in front of Cao Dehong before the experts of the Zhu Family could arrive. The moment they attacked, the experts of the Zhu Family were sent flying. </p>
			<p> They were the other three experts standing beside Huang Xiaolong, and all of them were at the peak of the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian might be Mei Jie’s son, but there was no way he could bring that many experts around as bodyguards! Out of the dozens of experts who came with him, there was only a single one at the peak of the grand completion stage! There was no way they would ever be able to stop Huang Xiaolong’s group. </p>
			<p> “You!” Zhu Yun glared at the three unexpected guests. </p>
			<p> Dao Dehong casually tossed Zhu Jian into the ground below. </p>
			<p> Rushing over as quickly as they could, Zhu Yun and the others helped him up. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, are you alright?” Zhu Yun asked. </p>
			<p> It would be a miracle if he was fine. With his arm broken by Cao Dehong and being flung into the ground after, he was in pretty bad shape. </p>
			<p> When they helped him up, Zhu Jian couldn’t believe what happened to him. He refused to believe that everything that happened was real. Ever since he was born, everything had gone his way. No one would dare lay a finger on him, much less break his arm and throw him into the ground. </p>
			<p> “How dare you!” Zhu Jian roared, “My grandfather is the master of the Zhu Lan Lands, and my father is the third strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Lands! How dare you touch me?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned to Cao Dehong and sighed, “Break his other arm too.” </p>
			<p> “You…” Before Zhu Jian could complete his sentence, Cao Dehong had already shattered his other arm. Zhu Jian’s screams tore through the air once again.  </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian roared, “Kill them all! Exterminate the Cao Family!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun and the others hesitated for a second while looking at each other. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, we… We should leave…” Zhu Yun whispered in Zhu Jian’s ear. </p>
			<p> With killing intent leaking from his eyes, Zhu Jian glared at Zhu Yun, but he was met with a shake of the head from Zhu Yun. He suppressed the killing intent the best he could and growled, “Alright, we should leave…” </p>
			<p> When they turned around, Zhu Jian glared at Huang Xiaolong with a look full of hatred. </p>
			<p> “Lord, should we…” One of the Gods of Creation behind Huang Xiaolong muttered while drawing a line across his neck slowly. </p>
			<p> “It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “It’s just a few ants.” </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang limped over to Cao Dehong slowly when he saw that the members of the Zhu Family had left. “Father, won’t the Zhu Family take revenge on our Cao Family now that…” </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to worry. With our Lord here, no one can do anything to us. Hurry up and greet the Lord!” He pointed towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Cao Kezhang and the others could only greet Huang Xiaolong respectfully after hearing what Cao Dehong said.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3642 – Stop Bothering Younger Sister Han’er&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> Allowing Cao Ying to get up, Huang Xiaolong ignored the other experts of the Cao Family. </p>
			<p> “This city is really busy. The night life is pretty good too. Let’s go walk around a little.” Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence for a second, but he didn’t say anything else. Bowing respectfully, he understood what Huang Xiaolong’s intentions were. When they just arrived, Huang Xiaolong planned on taking a look in the Cao Family’s residence. However, their actions earlier disgusted him so much that he didn’t want to look at their faces any more. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong and his group left the Cao Family Manor and they decided to stroll about the city aimlessly. Cao Kezhang and the others remained on their knees in the Cao Family Manor as they didn’t dare to get up without Huang Xiaolong’s explicit permission. </p>
			<p> When they saw their ancestor disappearing together with Huang Xiaolong, Cao Kezhang stared at his father in shock. Were they supposed to kneel there forever? </p>
			<p> “Father!” Cao Kezhang yelled. </p>
			<p> Ignoring his son, Cao Dehong continued to follow behind Huang Xiaolong. Only when they had disappeared from the sights of the members of the Cao Family did Cao Dehong plead with Huang XIaolong, “Your Highness, the members of the Cao Family…” </p>
			<p> “They can get up after kneeling for an entire day.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.  </p>
			<p> “Many thanks, Your Highness!” Cao Dehong bowed. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the others went around the city, Tao Han’er and the young master of the Jian Family, Jian Bifei, were also strolling about. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er arrived in the Stoneless City with the members of the Jian Family a day earlier. </p>
			<p> “There are many things to do in the city!” Tao Han’er chirped excitedly as she looked all around. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei laughed, “There are many fun things to do back in our Unparalleled City. Little Sister Han’er, you haven’t experienced all of it.” </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei was the son of the Jian Family’s patriarch, Jian Weifeng. As Tao Han’er was the daughter of Jian Weifeng’s seventh brother, she was considered Jian Bifei’s cousin. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er pouted softly, “No, there’s not! There’s nothing fun about the Unparalleled City. I cultivate every day without taking a break! Humph! I’m tired of looking at sword manuals! It’s so much more boring than when I lived in the Limitless Lands…” The figure of a young man appeared in her mind subconsciously. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei chuckled, “That’s because the ancestor thinks extremely highly of you. Not everyone can learn the Unparalleled Sword Manual you’re given! I'm not even qualified to look at it.” He continued, “I know that you’re thinking about your foster father. However, the two of you are from different worlds. There’s no need for you to meet in the future. Since he took care of you, I’ll send someone to give him a universe-level spiritual vein in the future.” </p>
			<p> He knew that Tao Han’er had a father called Tao Hang, but he also knew that he was a mere disciple in a small family of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> In Jian Bifei’s eyes, Tang Hang was nothing more than a mortal. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er pouted after hearing what he said. “Without him, I would have died a long time ago! The grace he has shown me isn’t worth a small spiritual vein…” </p>
			<p> “There’s the lord too! Without him, I would have died with my father! He saved us that year! He saved my life!” Tao Han’er yelled. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei frowned in response. “Han’er, you are now the princess of our Jian Family. Do you not know your status now? The man you call the Blue Dragon Young Master doesn't even have the qualifications to hold your shoe. In the future, do not call him lord any more. Otherwise, we’ll become a joke to the world.” </p>
			<p> He had long since gotten people to investigate Tao Hang and Huang Xiaolong. With his abilities, there was no way for him to uncover any of Huang Xiaolong’s secrets. All he knew was that Huang Xiaolong resided in the Golden Sea City. </p>
			<p> He heard about Huang Xiaolong’s act of defeating the three God of Creation Realm corpses. Even so, the number of God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage in the Jian Family was huge. They didn’t need to care about someone like Huang Xiaolong. 𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> When Tao Han’er heard how Jian Bifei looked down on Huang Xiaolong, she snorted angrily, “If you speak ill of the lord again, I’ll… I’ll tell grandfather that you’re bullying me!” </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei jumped in fright. “Alright, alright… I was wrong!” </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er snorted triumphantly and turned to leave. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Jian Family ran after her and they tried to appease her any way they could. No matter how hard they tried, she refused to speak to them. </p>
			<p> As she strolled along the streets, she caught sight of Huang Xiaolong and the others and she couldn’t help but stop in shock. </p>
			<p> “Lord! Father!” Tao Han’er yelled. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and Tao Hang were equally as surprised to meet her, and they slowly approached with Cao Dehong and the rest. </p>
			<p> “Han’er!” Tao Hang exclaimed happily as he started to walk over. </p>
			<p> Before he could approach, the experts of the Jian Family stopped him. They glared at Tao Hang like they would a mortal enemy. When Tao Han’er saw what was going on, she yelled, “Go away! That’s my father!” </p>
			<p> The experts of the Jian Family hesitated slightly as they turned to look at Jian Bifei. </p>
			<p> With a frown on his face, Jian Bifei eventually nodded for him to back down. </p>
			<p> “Han’er!” Surprise filled his face and tears of joy streamed down hers. “Father… How have you been all these years?”” </p>
			<p> “Great! I broke through to the Dao Venerable Realm thanks to Lord Huang…” Tao Hang nodded. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er ran over to Huang Xiaolong and bowed, “Many thanks to the lord…”  </p>
			<p> Chuckling in amusement, Huang Xiaolong replied, “Don’t worry about it. It’s been so many years and you have become more beautiful since then!” </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er lowered her head and blushed slightly, “Why did you guys come to the Zhu Lan Lands?” </p>
			<p> “Naturally, we came over to see you.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s eyes turned into tiny little crescents and the grin on her face grew wider. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei’s frown got deeper when he saw the exchange happening between them. Stepping up, he said to Tao Han’er, “It’s getting late. We should return. Lord Jian Long told us not to stay out for too long.” </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er revealed a reluctant expression, but Huang Xiaolong quickly interrupted them, “In that case, you should return. We can meet again at the auction tomorrow.” </p>
			<p> “Are you going to the auction too? That’s great!” Tao Han’er jumped in joy. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei signaled for the experts of the Jian Family to bring Tao Han’er away before approaching Huang Xiaolong alone. </p>
			<p> “Are you the person they call the Blue Dragon Young Master? Let me tell you right now, Little Sister Han’er is the princess of my Jian Family. Your status is like dirt compared to hers. Stop bothering her in the future. She’s not someone you can hope to latch up to.” </p>
			<p> He turned to Tao Hang and growled after speaking to Huang Xiaolong, “In the future, you better not tell anyone you were her foster father…”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3643 – Raising a Marriage Request to the Jian Family&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Just as Tao Hang was about to refute, Jian Bifei brought out a spatial ring and tossed it over. “There’s a low-grade universe-level spiritual vein in there. You should know how precious that is. It’s something you will never be able to obtain even if you used your whole life trying. Let it be your reward for raising Little Sister Han’er.” </p>
			<p> Tao Hang’s expression fluctuated, but Huang Xiaolong reacted before he could say anything. </p>
			<p> “Heh, isn’t it just a low-grade universe-level spiritual vein?” He said before tossing out two high-grade universe-level spiritual veins. </p>
			<p> In a state of shock, Jian Bifei was sent flying backwards from the impact of the two spiritual veins crashing into him. </p>
			<p> “Here’s two high-grade ones. Since you look like a beggar, you can have them.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Take these and get out of my face.” </p>
			<p> “You’re looking to die!” Jian Bifei roared as he crawled to his feet. His sword stabbed towards Huang Xiaolong as rays of resplendent light emerged from the tip. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he was stronger than Yu Jingyu and Wu Qifeng of the Limitless Lands! </p>
			<p> Well… 𝘧𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> Before his sword could even arrive, a hand emerged from behind Huang Xiaolong to catch the blade.  </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong was the one who moved, and Jian Bifei roared in anger, “Cao Dehong, how dare you stand in my way? Even though I don’t know why the few of you are standing on his side, I’ll exterminate your clans if you obstruct me!” </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong flicked his finger casually and sent Jian Bifei tumbling to the side. </p>
			<p> “Exterminate my clan?” Cao Dehong raised an eyebrow slightly. “Let’s talk about it if you have the ability to do so.” </p>
			<p> “Great… Great!” Jian Bifei got to his feet and glared at everyone on Huang Xiaolong’s side. </p>
			<p> “We’ll meet again.” He spat before turning to leave. </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s cheery laughter rang in his ears, “You’re right. We most definitely will.” </p>
			<p> He didn’t make things difficult for Jian Bifei as he allowed the man to leave. </p>
			<p> Hesitating slightly, Tao Hang asked, “Lord, should we notify Han’er about our issue with the Jian Family?” He naturally referred to the difference between the Xiaohong Celestial Empire and the Jian Family. Even though Yu Xiaohong taught Jian Xiyuan and the others a small lesson, the tyrannical Jian Family wouldn’t let things go. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Of course not. Jian Wushuang isn’t strong enough for us to care about him. At best, he’s a side character…” </p>
			<p> Side character?! </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong and the others revealed a bitter smile when they heard what he said. Those in the Unknown Lands who could call Jian Wushuang a side character could probably be counted on one hand. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong strolled around for a little more and headed over to the residence of another God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage to rest for the night. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked through the sword manual, the night passed unknowingly. He only realized that morning had arrived when Cao Dehong and the others came over to notify him. </p>
			<p> “If you didn’t come to look for me, I wouldn’t have realized that dawn had broken!” Huang Xiaolong joked. </p>
			<p> “Lord, you can comprehend the sword manual due to your overwhelming talent. If we obtained the sword manual, we wouldn’t be able to comprehend it.” Cao Dehong praised. </p>
			<p> Chuckling lightly, Huang Xiaolong knew that Cao Dehong was trying to kiss his *ss. However, there was some truth in his words. Not many people could comprehend the sword intent contained in the sword manual written by Jian Wushuang. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go. The auction should be starting.” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and headed towards the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. </p>
			<p> As it wasn’t too far from the place they were staying, the group arrived in less than half an hour. </p>
			<p> It was a perfect coincidence that they ran into Zhu Jian, Zhu Yun, and the others at the entrance of the chamber of commerce. </p>
			<p> When Zhu Jian and the others saw Huang Xiaolong’s party, they were shocked. “It’s you guys!” Zhu Jian growled with hostility in his voice the moment they met. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong snorted casually as he looked at Zhu Jian’s arm. “You’re pretty healthy… Looks like your arm is alright now.” </p>
			<p> Just the day before, Cao Dehong shattered Zhu Jian’s arms. He obviously used a ton of precious herbs to recover after returning. </p>
			<p> Killing intent flashed in Zhu Jian’s eyes after he heard what Huang Xiaolong said, “I’ll make you regret your actions soon!” </p>
			<p> “I’ll be waiting.” Huang Xiaolong said as a yawn threatened to escape his lips. </p>
			<p> Snorting angrily, Zhu Jian wanted to enter the hall. Before they could, a shockingly powerful aura appeared to lock them in their place. </p>
			<p> “Cao Dehong, what’s the meaning of this?!” Zhu Jian glared at Cao Dehong and roared. </p>
			<p> Ignoring the man, Cao Dehong gestured for Huang Xiaolong to enter the venue. “Lord, please.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded contentedly as he entered the hall. Tao Hang, Cao Dehong, and the others followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian raged in his heart when he saw what had happened. </p>
			<p> “Young Master, don’t be angry. They should be here to obtain some treasures. When they bid for the items they want, we can outbid them at every turn.” Zhu Yun whispered into Zhu Jian’s ear. </p>
			<p> Suppressing the anger in his heart, Zhu Jian snapped, “Alright, this young master will play them to death later. I refuse to believe that that brat has more money than me!” </p>
			<p> The Zhu Family was the strongest power in the Zhu Lan Lands! Their wealth was terrifying! As Zhu Chen’s grandson and Mei Jie’s son, Zhu Jian possessed shocking wealth!  </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the others stepped into the auction venue, Tao Han’er’s adorable voice rang through the air. “Lord, Father, I’m over here!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the rest turned to see Tao Han’er walking towards them. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei and the rest of the Jian Family had arrived a long time ago and they were sitting in one of the VIP pavilions. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and Tao Hang exchanged greetings with her. </p>
			<p> As for Jian Bifei, he glared at Huang Xiaolong with killing intent brewing in his eyes. </p>
			<p> He seemed to be the only angry one as Huang Xiaolong ignored him completely. He headed over to another VIP pavilion beside the Jian Family. Huang Xiaolong might not be a venerated guest of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, but Cao Dehong was! As the old ancestor of the Cao Family, he was naturally held in high regard by the chamber of commerce. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian who arrived later didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to know Tao Han’er, and he was shocked to hear the exchange between them! </p>
			<p> “That… Is that the princess of the Jian Family?” Zhu Jian asked Zhu Yun. </p>
			<p> “Yes, young master.” Zhu Yun replied. “That’s her. It’s said that she was left in the Limitless Lands a long time ago. The Jian Family only managed to locate her after using up a ton of resources. Her talent is extremely good. Lord Jian Wushuang plans to cultivate her into his successor!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian’s heart trembled slightly. “That brat seems to possess some kind of relationship with her. Do you think that the brat will go crazy if I ask for the Jian Family princess’ hand in marriage during the ceremony in a few days?”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3644 – Lord Gui Chi&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Zhu Yun’s eyes lit up and he giggled, “Young Master, that’s a great plan! With your status, the Jian Family’s old ancestor will be more than happy to accept! When the brat hears of it, he’ll go crazy with frustration!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian revealed a sinister laugh. No one knew if it was intended, but he chose the pavilion beside Tao Han’er. As Huang Xiaolong took the pavilion on her right, Zhu Jian took the one on her left. </p>
			<p> After entering the pavilion, Zhu Jian got Zhu Yun to send Jian Bifei his greetings. Very quickly, laughter filled the other pavilion as Zhu Yun introduced his young master to Jian Bifei. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Jian’s fame long precedes him.” Jian Bifei grinned. </p>
			<p> Cupping his fist, Zhu Jian returned the pleasantry. “I’ve heard of Brother Jian Bifei’s achievements too! It’s an honor to meet you today. Now that I’ve seen you in person, I can confirm that you’re a dragon amongst men!” </p>
			<p> “Young Master Zhu Jian is the true genius… Your talent overshadows everyone in the younger generation of the Zhu Lan Lands!” Jian Bifei continued. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian pretended to look around and his gaze landed on Tao Han’er. “This… Is this your long lost young lady?” </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei quickly introduced, “Yes! This is my younger sister, Han’er! Han’er, quick! Come over and greet Young Master Zhu Jian of the Zhu Family!” </p>
			<p> Afraid that she wouldn’t know who he was, Jian Bifei continued the introductions, “Young Master Zhu Jian is the grandson of Lord Zhu Chen! He’s also the son of the third strongest expert of our Zhu Lan Lands, Mei Jie!”  </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er wasn’t planning to bother with the group at all. However, she had no choice after hearing Jian Bifei’s introductions. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian smiled, “Young Lady Han’er’s talent has long reached my ears.” </p>
			<p> “Brother Zhu Jian, do you mean…” Jian Bifei muttered. </p>
			<p> “Young Lady Han’er’s beauty is unparalleled. She’s the greatest beauty in the Zhu Lan Lands.” Zhu Jian laughed. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei laughed with him. The two of them shot an unconscious gaze towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Noticing the stupid expression on Zhu Jian’s face, Huang Xiaolong sniggered silently in his heart. </p>
			<p> Soon, the auction began. </p>
			<p> The first item was a jade hairpin. It was said to be a low-grade creation artifact made by a half-step Universe God. Moreover, it was made by a female God of Creation who had worn it for a long time. Even though it didn’t possess offensive abilities, the defensive properties weren’t too bad. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s eyes lit up when she saw the hairpin. It was clear she loved it a lot. </p>
			<p> When she learned that the starting price was a trillion dao coins, the light in her eyes dimmed. Since she followed Jian Bifei to the auction, she didn’t bring much money with her. </p>
			<p> “Does Han’er like this hairpin?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice came from the side. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er nodded softly in response. “I do! This is really similar to the hairpin you gave me the other year… Back in the Hengshan Mountain Range, the hairpin saved my life! But the hairpin was broken beyond repair…” A look of guilt appeared on her face. It was as though she was sorry for breaking the present he gave her. </p>
			<p> “Since you like it, I’ll get it for you.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled mischievously. </p>
			<p> “Really? Thank you!” Tao Han’er jumped in joy. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong glanced at Cao Dehong and the latter immediately knew what to do. </p>
			<p> “1.01 trillion.” Cao Dehong started things off. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian’s voice came from the side. “1.1 trillion!” </p>
			<p> Everyone looked at him, dumbfounded. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian looked at Jian Bifei and smiled, “Since Young Lady Han’er likes it, I’ll buy it for you!”  </p>
			<p> Theft is never good, try looking at FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei responded, “Young Master Zhu Jian’s favor will be remembered by our Jian Family.” </p>
			<p> “It’s just a hairpin. Even if Young Lady Han’er likes a peak-grade creation artifact, I’ll buy it for her!” Zhu Jian continued to boast. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s eyebrows scrunched together when she heard what he said. </p>
			<p> Gently raising two fingers at Cao Dehong, the bidding continued. “Two trillion!” </p>
			<p> “Three trillion!” Zhu Jian wasn’t willing to back down. </p>
			<p> “3.5 trillion.” Seemingly having lost his patience, Huang Xiaolong called out his bid personally. </p>
			<p> The crowd started to clamor instantly. </p>
			<p> “4 trillion!” Zhu Jian sneered. </p>
			<p> “40 trillion.” Huang Xiaolong snorted coldly as soon as Zhu Jian spoke. </p>
			<p> “What?! 40 trillions?! The entire venue erupted.” </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> “Who is he? Even the old ancestors of the Cao and three other families treat him so respectfully… Moreover, he seems familiar with the young princess of the Jian Family!” </p>
			<p> “The Zhu Family is the true owner of the Zhu Lan Lands… He’s stupid for trying to go against Zhu Jian!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian’s expression sank and he wanted to raise the price. However, Zhu Yun stopped him. “Young Master, forget about it. That’s 40 trillion we’re talking about! From the looks of it, the brat doesn’t plan to stop. We don’t have to go against him for the sake of it. It’s just a hairpin. In the future, we’ll get the experts of our family to make a better one for Young Lady Han’er!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian hesitated slightly before turning to Tao Han’er. “Young Lady Han’er, this hairpin is a low-grade creation artifact. It’s not worthy to be worn by you. In the future, I’ll get the experts of my family to refine a better one for you.” </p>
			<p> Jian Bifei added, “Young Master Zhu Jian is right! The treasury of my Jian Family is filled with stuff like that! Little Sister Han’er deserves much more! Only a bumpkin would buy a hairpin for 40 trillion…” </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong snorted in contempt when he heard their conversation. “Didn’t Young Master Zhu Jian say that he would buy the hairpin for young miss over there? What’s wrong? Are you too poor to buy a low-grade creation artifact?” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian’s face flushed red with embarrassment. However, he didn’t continue to bid.  </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong sent Cao Dehong to pay for the hairpin, he got the auctioneer to pass it to Tao Han’er. As she held it tightly in her hand, she turned to Huang Xiaolong with a sweet smile, “Many thanks, Lord Huang!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded in response. </p>
			<p> Soon, the auction continued. </p>
			<p> There were many rare treasures that were on sale, but none of them caught Huang Xiaolong’s eye. He didn’t join in the bidding, but Zhu Jian and Jian Bifei got quite a few items for themselves. </p>
			<p> After more than a dozen items were auctioned off, the final item was revealed. It was a batch of universe-level spiritual veins! </p>
			<p> The auctioneer did some simple introductions and everyone learned that there were sixteen peak-grade universe-level spiritual veins in the batch and fifty-three high-grade ones. The others were of the mid and low grade. </p>
			<p> Ordinarily, no one would sell precious goods like that! They would only trade it for other treasures! As the auction started, no base price was set. Everyone was allowed to yell their bids and the highest would win! Of course, no one was stupid enough to purchase them with dao coins. Creation artifacts were used as the currency for bidding. </p>
			<p> “Ten high-grade creation artifacts!” A black robed man started it off. 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> As he sat in the corner of the venue, no one noticed him until he called his first bid. </p>
			<p> The faces of Zhu Jian and Jian Bifei changed when they recognized him. “Lord Gui Chi!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3645 – Lord Gui Chi’s Rage&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The faces of Cao Dehong and the others also changed greatly. </p>
			<p> Anyone with any bit of knowledge in the auction venue revealed a terrified expression. There were even some who got to their knees instantly! Among them were Gods of Creation at the great completion stage and the peak of the great completion stage. </p>
			<p> That was how famous Gui Chi was! </p>
			<p> Of course, he had long been noticed by Huang Xiaolong. Even at his level, he wasn’t able to avoid detection from Huang Xiaolong’s three great dao souls. </p>
			<p> In the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen stood at the very peak! Their strength were ranked in that exact order, and Gui Chi was the Green Ghost’s strongest general! </p>
			<p> The Green Ghost had been in seclusion for countless years, and Gui Chi was the one taking care of everything. Seeing him was equivalent to meeting Lord Green Ghost! </p>
			<p> Of course, Gui Chi possessed horrifying strength to back up his identity. His combat strength was close to 19 billion units of grand cosmos energy and he was one of the ten strongest individuals in the Unknown Lands! </p>
			<p> After getting over their shock, Zhu Jian, Jian Bifei, and the others bowed. Even though he was Zhu Chen’s grandson, he had to show the man some respect. </p>
			<p> The only person who remained seated other than Gui Chi was Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong and the others were afraid of Gui Chi’s identity, but they didn’t dare to bow when they saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t moving. </p>
			<p> His action, or lack thereof, became the most eye-catching thing in the auction venue! </p>
			<p> When Zhu Jian and the others saw Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalance, they celebrated in their hearts. They were obviously waiting for Gui Chi to fly into rage and kill Huang Xiaolong with a single slap. </p>

			<p> Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong casually, but he refrained from doing anything. Instead, he turned to the auctioneer and said, “If no one else bids, I’ll be taking the batch of spiritual veins.” </p>
			<p> The auctioneer nodded obediently. “Of course. According to the rules of our chamber of commerce, the goods will go to the highest bidder.” </p>
			<p> After he revealed his identity, no fool would dare to challenge him. </p>
			<p> Of course, those fools only referred to the weaklings who were weaker than himself. </p>
			<p> “Eleven high-grade creation artifacts.” </p>
			<p> When everyone turned to stare in the direction of the newest bid, they were shocked to discover that Cao Dehong was the one who called it! </p>
			<p> He wasn’t in a great position either. Cao Dehong’s heart palpitated after calling the bid. It was clear that he only did what he did because of Huang Xiaolong’s order. </p>
			<p> Gui Chi finally took a closer look at Huang Xiaolong’s pavilion. His gaze caused Cao Dehong and the others to feel their scalps going numb. </p>
			<p> “Twelve.” Gui Chi stared directly at Cao Dehong as he made another bid. 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> “Thirteen.” Cao Dehong continued. </p>
			<p> “Fourteen.” With his face remaining expressionless, no one could tell what he was thinking. </p>
			<p> “Fifteen pieces.” There was no going back for Cao Dehong. He could only go all in. He swore that he had never felt so afraid in his life. </p>
			<p> “Sixteen!” Gui Chi growled and his change in tone was clear to everyone. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong looked at Huang Xiaolong and received no response. He could only continue. “Seventeen…” </p>
			<p> Gui Chi frowned and his gaze arrived on Huang Xiaolong. “Brat, I might admire your courage, but that doesn’t mean that I like it when other people go against me intentionally.” </p>
			<p> Everyone could see that Cao Dehong was only acting on Huang Xiaolong’s orders. </p>
			<p> Looking at Gui Chi from the corner of his eye, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “What a coincidence. I hate it when people go against me too.” </p>
			<p> Gui Chi was stunned, and so was everyone else. </p>
			<p> Were they mistaken?! Did Huang Xiaolong just declare war on Gui Chi? </p>
			<p> A piercing laughter left Gui Chi’s lips. </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun celebrated in his heart. He whispered to Zhu Jian, “The brat is done for now… Lord Gui Chi is completely enraged! That’s the only time he will laugh!” </p>
			<p> “Brat, I don’t know where you’re finding the courage to go against me.” Gui Chi roared with laughter, “Haven’t those ants beside you told you who I am?” </p>
			<p> Naturally, he referred to Cao Dehong and the rest. </p>
			<p> No one in the crowd thought that there was a problem with how he referred to them. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed softly, “Looks like you’re overestimating yourself. I can do whatever I like.” </p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong from head to toe again. He felt that Huang Xiaolong was the greatest clown he had met. How else was he supposed to explain the kid’s death wish of going against him? </p>
			<p> He could tell that Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> The only thing he found weird was that Cao Dehong and the others were treating him with respect. From the looks of it, the kid wasn’t an ordinary expert at the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> When everyone thought that Gui Chi would make a move on Huang Xiaolong, he remained silent. </p>
			<p> After some time, the auctioneer mustered the courage to break the silence. “Lord Cao Dehong bids seventeen high-grade creation artifacts. Are there any higher bids?” </p>
			<p> The gazes of everyone present landed on Gui Chi. </p>
			<p> He didn’t seem to notice the looks he was getting and he continued to look at Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian and the others hesitated slightly, but Zhu Yun shot Zhu Jian a look and the latter lowered his head. He could only give up. </p>
			<p> After tapping his hammer thrice, the auctioneer proclaimed that Huang Xiaolong was the winner of the auction. </p>
			<p> At that point, the auction ended. </p>
			<p> “Lord Huang, the auction has ended. Are you going to leave the city?” Han Tao’er asked reluctantly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Relax. I’ll head over to your Jian Family for the ceremony. Tao Hang will be there too.” </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er was stunned for a second, and so were Jian Bifei, Zhu Jian, and the others. </p>
			<p> “Really?!” Tao Han’er beamed. “Great! I’ll be waiting for you!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong smiled before leaving the venue with Cao Dehong and the others. </p>
			<p> When Jian Bifei saw Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure, a sneer left his lips. He couldn’t be happier if Huang Xiaolong came for the Jian Family’s ceremony. </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Zhu Jian’s eyes. He made up his mind to do something at the ceremony, but when he looked at the corner where Gui Chi was, he noticed that the expert had already disappeared.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3646 – Ceremony&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Zhu Jian and the others eventually left the auction venue, but before they did, Jian Bifei enthusiastically invited Zhu Jian to the Jian Family’s ceremony. </p>
			<p> Laughing happily, Zhu Jian responded, “How can I possibly reject Brother Bifei’s invitation? I will definitely show up!” </p>
			<p> After all, he had his own plans. He glanced at Tao Han’er at the side. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Zhu Chen and the rest arrived back at their residence. </p>
			<p> “Do you think the brat will really show up at the Jian Family?” Zhu Jian asked his fellow clansmen. </p>
			<p> “Probably. The ceremony will be held in one month. Since Lord Gui Chi appeared, he should be headed over too.” Zhu Yun explained. </p>
			<p> “Oh? Will Lord Gui Chi also show up at the ceremony?” Zhu Jian gasped. </p>
			<p> “I’m afraid he will…” Zhu Yun sighed. “Since Lord Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion mark barrier, our Unknown Lands will only grow stronger. Lord Green Ghost might not come, but Lord Gui Chi will be here to send his congratulations.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian nodded slowly. “Alas… Lord Gui Chi didn’t do anything to that brat today!”  </p>
			<p> “Lord Gui Chi might not do anything today, but we can look for opportunities for the brat to offend Lord Gui Chi during the ceremony. Countless experts will be present then. When that happens, Lord Gui Chi wouldn’t let him off easily! He’ll kill the brat on the spot!” Zhu Yun laughed. </p>
			<p> “Great! We’ll do that then!” Zhu Jian continued, “My father will personally come for the ceremony, and he shall raise the topic of marriage on my behalf!” </p>

			<p> “Before the brat dies, he’ll learn of the marriage between Tao Han’er and myself! He won’t be able to die a peaceful death!” Zhu Jian roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong had already returned to Zhu Fei’s residence when Zhu Jian’s thoughts were running wild. A formless figure appeared in the skies above and melded completely with the void. No one could tell that there was someone there! </p>
			<p> Obviously, the only one who had the ability to avoid the detection of so many experts had to be Gui Chi! He hid his presence the best he could, but he was still discovered by Huang Xiaolong easily. </p>
			<p> He stood in the skies, not knowing that he was already discovered. He looked into the residence, trying to find Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The kid had successfully caught his attention. He could feel that there was some sort of secret hiding in the kid’s body, but he quickly saw the Unparalleled Sword Manual in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. </p>
			<p> “Isn’t that Jian Wushuang’s Sword Manual?!” </p>
			<p> He couldn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong got his hands on it. Could he be Jian Wushuang’s successor? </p>
			<p> That wasn’t possible. When thoughts were running through his mind, Huang Xiaolong raised his right hand slightly. No one knew if it was intentional, but he released a strand of sword qi that shot towards Gui Chi. The speed was so fast that Gui Chi couldn’t even dodge. </p>
			<p> He released a strand of energy from his finger in a desperate attempt to stop the sword qi. </p>
			<p> A loud blast rang in his ears as the two attacks collided. A shocking amount of power ripped through the air and it sent Gui Chi tumbling outwards. When he finally stabilized his footing, he discovered that he had flown countless miles away! He tried to suppress the shock in his heart. </p>
			<p> The sword qi was clearly meant for him! </p>
			<p> However, how could a casual wave from the other party send him flying?! </p>
			<p> How strong did the other party have to be to do something like that?! </p>
			<p> There was only one explanation. The kid he was trying to spy on had already broken through the 20 billion mark barrier! Moreover, he wasn’t a rookie like Jian Wushuang who had just broken through! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to force Gui Chi back so easily!  </p>
			<p> A look of suspicion could be seen on Gui Chi’s face. </p>
			<p> When in the world did such a terrifying expert appear in the Unknown Lands?! Moreover, no one noticed his arrival! </p>
			<p> As he stood there, another strand of sword qi appeared. This time, it was several times stronger than before. Before he could react, a hole was torn through his clothes. </p>
			<p> Was that intentional?! 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> Too scared to remain there, Gui Chi disappeared into the distance. </p>
			<p> No one in the outside world saw what happened, and the shockwaves were suppressed by a formless aura Huang Xiaolong released. The only ones who noticed what had happened were Cao Dehong, Zhu Fei, and those standing near Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> All of them couldn’t tell the outcome of the exchange as they weren’t strong enough to detect Gui Chi’s presence, but from the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong had won! Shock battered their hearts. </p>
			<p> They knew that Huang Xiaolong was stronger than the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race, but they only had a blurry understanding of his strength. </p>
			<p> Now, they realized that he was much stronger than they thought! </p>
			<p> Was it possible that Huang Xiaolong had the ability to suppress Jian Wushuang alone?! </p>
			<p> Perhaps, he could fight toe to toe with Zhu Chen! Even if he couldn’t, his strength shouldn’t be too far off… </p>
			<p> “Is the date of the ceremony decided?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong and the others snapped back to reality. “Reporting to the lord, the date has been set. It will take place in a month!” </p>
			<p> “Alright. You can leave now. I’m going to continue studying the sword manual. You can call me when the time comes.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong and the rest left respectfully. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, twenty two days had passed. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong and the rest came to notify Huang Xiaolong as their journey to the Jian Family would take close to eight days! They had to leave soon if they wished to make it in time. </p>
			<p> Keeping the sword manual, Huang Xiaolong left for the Unparalleled City.  </p>
			<p> Seven days later, they arrived. </p>
			<p> “Lord, I heard that Mei Jie and the experts of the Zhu Family arrived in the city the day before.” Cao Dehong reported. </p>
			<p> “Oh? Mei Jie?!” Huang Xiaolong was pleasantly surprised. </p>
			<p> Cao Dehong nodded and continued, “Mei Jie represents the Zhu Family to congratulate Jian Wushuang. However, he dotes on his son a lot, and he probably came because of Zhu Jian.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. “Haha, do you think the little brat called his father here to deal with me?” </p>
			<p> Can Dehong lowered his head slightly. “Probably…” </p>
			<p> An imperceptible grin flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> Mei Jie! </p>
			<p> He was the only one who escaped when Huang Xiaolong crushed the Creation Palace! Since Mei Jie chose to interfere, Huang Xiaolong decided that he would deal with the last of his problems with the Creation Palace during the ceremony. At the same time, he could settle the Jian Family. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree sneakily and hid it in the space around the city. Trillions of branches and roots extended silently around the city, enclosing it within.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3647 – You Can’t Owe Me A Single Cent&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> At his current cultivation level, Huang Xiaolong gained complete control over the Star Dragon Divine Tree. It became nothing more than an extension of his limbs. Moreover, there was no one in the city who detected its presence. At Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation level, not even Jian Wushuang would be able to notice something Huang Xiaolong didn’t allow him to! </p>
			<p> “Your Highness, I have some foundations in the Unparalleled City. Would you like to rest there for the night?” Zhu Fei asked. </p>
			<p> “Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> The group quickly followed Zhu Fei and they approached the Zhu Family’s property in the Unparalleled City. It was called the Zhu Family Tea House, and they specialized in selling all sorts of tea. Their business was booming and they had so much money they managed to extend their hands to many industries in the Zhu Lan Lands. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the rest entered, the entire hall was filled to the brim. </p>
			<p> “Looks like your business isn’t bad!” Huang Xiaolong joked. </p>
			<p> Zhu Fei scratched his head and smiled, “I’m just messing around to keep my family alive… Please don’t mind us, Your Highness…” </p>
			<p> Laughter filled the air as Zhu Fei invited them into the inner courtyard. </p>
			<p> Leaving the main hall, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the courtyard and rooms within were extremely elegant and quiet. It formed a stark contrast with the scene outside.  </p>
			<p> “It’s a nice place.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright. Go ahead and take a break. The ceremony will be held tomorrow. We’ll head there then.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Fei and the others acknowledged his order. However, a disturbance occurred before they could leave. A loud cry came from the main hall. </p>
			<p> From the looks of it, someone was attacked in the Zhu Family Tea House! </p>
			<p> “Let’s go take a look.” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> “Your Highness, it’s alright. There’s no need to trouble you for this. I shall head out alone.” </p>
			<p> “It’s fine. We have nothing to do anyway.” Huang Xiaolong spoke as he headed towards the main hall. </p>
			<p> As soon as they arrived, they saw a few disciples of the Jian Family surrounding a fallen disciple of the Zhu Family. There was a giant dent in the Zhu Family disciple’s chest, and everyone could see that the man was crippled. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?” Zhu Fei summoned the manager of the shop and his expression sank. </p>
			<p> The manager was a grand elder of the Zhu Family, and he was an expert at the Dao Venerable Realm who had comprehened twelve elements to the grand completion stage. He knew who Zhu Fei was, and he replied respectfully, “Old Ancestor, the grand elders of the Jian Clan have always bought stuff from us. They never paid, and they said to keep it on their tab. As of now, they owe us more than ten billion dao coins! They’re here to buy more tea leaves and the sum of their purchase this time is close to that amount! Even so, they don’t plan on paying.” </p>
			<p> “The disciple requested for them to settle their bill and the disciples of the Jian Family crippled him!” </p>
			<p> One of the Jian Family’s grand elders sneered as he stared down at the fallen disciple. “Our old ancestor broke through the 20 billion units barrier and we’re holding a celebration ceremony tomorrow. It’s your Zhu Family's honor to be supplying the tea leaves we require. How dare you ask us to pay? Do you believe that I’ll demolish your Zhu Family Tea House right here and now?!” </p>
			<p> “What about the amount you already owe us?” The disciple gasped in pain. </p>
			<p> “Owe you? Since when do we owe you money?” The grand elder sneered. </p>
			<p> It was clear that he didn’t plan to pay. </p>
			<p> Another one of the grand elders stared at the disciple and snorted in contempt. “How dare you attempt to scam our Jian Family?! You must be tired of living!” A sword appeared in his hand as he hacked downwards. A flash of light filled the hall as he planned to cut the disciple in two. With the injuries the disciple already suffered, he wouldn’t be able to avoid the strike!  </p>
			<p> Just as the sword light was about to cleave the disciple in two, another flash of light appeared and the grand elder’s body froze up. </p>
			<p> A tiny hole could be seen in the middle of his forehead, and all signs of life drained from his body! </p>
			<p> Without a doubt, he was dead! 𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> Not even his dao soul managed to escape. </p>
			<p> The members of the Jian Family looked at their dead grand elder in shock. </p>
			<p> When everyone turned to the source of the interference, they saw Huang Xiaolong’s group. Of course, Huang Xiaolong was just standing there. The person who moved was Zhu Fei. </p>
			<p> The other grand elders of the Jian Family had no idea Zhu Fei was and they raged, “How dare you kill a grand elder of our Jian Family?! You’re dead! Your entire Zhu Family is dead!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Fei didn’t speak. Instead, Huang Xiaolong muttered softly as he looked at the body collapsing to the ground. “Tell the members of your Jian Family to come over to pay your debts. You can leave after you pay, otherwise, no one is leaving today.” </p>
			<p> Those in the main hall stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> “Who is he?! Is he really planning to kill everyone from the Jian Family if they don’t pay up?” </p>
			<p> “He’s crazy! The Jian Family’s ceremony will be held tomorrow, and he killed a grand elder of the Jian Family in the Unparalleled City right under their noses!” </p>
			<p> One of the grand elders of the Jian Family couldn’t contain his anger anymore and he snorted at Huang Xiaolong, “Heh, do you really plan on killing all of us if we refuse to bring the money over?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Didn’t you hear what I said? I won’t dirty my hands with you ants. Someone else will kill you.” </p>
			<p> “Hmph! My ancestor is Eminent Elder Jian Dalong of the Jian Family! Let’s see if you dare to stop me from leaving?” The grand elder who spoke earlier snapped. </p>
			<p> The spectators in the main hall gasped in fright.  </p>
			<p> “Jian Dalong! He’s a God of Creation at the grand completion stage!” </p>
			<p> When they were still discussing the grand elder’s ancestor, he had already taken a step towards the entrance. </p>
			<p> Right before he could leave, a ray of light shot past his figure and his head was flung through the air. His body crumpled slowly towards the entrance. </p>
			<p> The rest of the grand elders of the Jian Family froze in place when they saw what happened. </p>
			<p> The experts in the hall stared at Zhu Fei in shock. </p>
			<p> Was he crazy?! </p>
			<p> He actually dared to make a move on them! </p>
			<p> The person he killed was the grandson of an eminent elder from the Jian Family! Moreover, the eminent elder was an existence at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored the stares of surprise and his voice rang through the hall again. “You can notify them to bring the money now. Bring a coffin for him too. Anyway, remember to bring enough money. You can’t owe me a single cent!” </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3648 – Weak&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> In the main hall, everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong like he was some sort of monster. What he said was too crazy! Moreover, he killed yet another grand elder of the Jian Family! </p>
			<p> In the eyes of a peak-tier family like the Zhu Family, tens of billions of dao coins was nothing much. However, Huang Xiaolong killed grand elders of the Jian Family. That wasn’t a smart move at all! </p>
			<p> The three remaining grand elders felt the blood draining from their faces. Eventually, they sent out messages to the higher ups of their family. </p>
			<p> “We contacted the experts of our Jian Family! Just wait for them to come!” One of them yelled. </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> The news of a grand elder’s death quickly spread through the city and many experts learned about it. </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian was also able to learn of the news. He stared at Zhu Yun in disbelief. “Someone killed a grand elder of the Jian Family under their noses?!” </p>
			<p> “Yes. It just happened in the Zhu Family Tea House. I heard that it happened because the Jian Family owed them several billions.” Zhu Yun explained. </p>
			<p> “Just because of a few billion?” Zhu Jian frowned.  </p>
			<p> The amount wasn’t even enough for him to spend for several days! </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun laughed, “Young Master, you wouldn’t believe who killed them…” </p>
			<p> Zhu Jian looked at Zhu Yun curiously. </p>
			<p> “It’s that kid!” Zhu Yun laughed. </p>
			<p> “What?! That brat really came?” Zhu Jian was pleasantly surprised. </p>
			<p> Obviously, he knew that Zhu Yun referred to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Yes! He entered the city with Cao Dehong and the others, and they went to the Zhu Family Tea House and killed the grand elders of the Jian Family! He also said that they wouldn’t be able to leave unless they paid up.” Zhu Yun laughed. “Lord Jian Weifeng has already been notified. In a fit of rage, he sent Eminent Elder Jian Shengdong over to deal with the problem.” </p>
			<p> “Lord Jian Shengdong?” Zhu Jian was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> There were four experts in the Jian Family who had broken through the 10 billion units mark. They were Jian Wushuang, Jian Weifeng, the leader of the eminent elders, Jian Xiyuan, and Jian Shengdong! </p>
			<p> Even though Jian Shengdong might not be as strong as Jian Xiyuan, he had broken through countless years ago! It was said that he had close to 10.5 billion units of combat strength! In the Zhu Lan Lands, Jian Shengdong was a force to be reckoned with. </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun grinned, “Yes. Lord Jian Shengdong brought two half-step Universe God Realm eminent elders of the Jian Family over to the tea house! The brat is dead!” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Zhu Yun was right. Jian Shengdong indeed brought the experts of the Jian Family over. Other than two half-step Universe Gods, there were ten Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage! </p>
			<p> The thirteen of them exuded a monstrous amount of sword qi as they barged over. </p>
			<p> “Isn’t that Lord Jian Shengdong of the Jian Family? What’s going on?!” Someone on the streets asked when they noticed what was going on. </p>
			<p> “Didn’t you hear? Someone killed two grand elders of the Jian Family in the Zhu Family Tea House! Three other grand elders are currently held hostage there!” </p>
			<p> “What?! Is the person crazy?” </p>
			<p> The news quickly spread through the city and many people learned of what happened. The experts who had arrived in the Unparalleled City rushed over to the Zhu Family Tea House in order to watch the show that would play out when Jian Shengdong arrived. They were extremely curious about the identity of the person who was insane enough to do something like that! </p>
			<p> Very quickly, Jian Shengdong arrived. </p>
			<p> With expressionless faces, the thirteen experts of the Jian Family entered the Zhu Family Tea House. Those inside were smart enough to take their leave. </p>
			<p> Those who knew what was going on had already hid themselves quite a distance away to watch the show. </p>
			<p> Jian Shengdong’s gaze swept across the hall as soon as he entered. When he saw the corpses of the grand elders, his expression sank. </p>
			<p> “Eminent Elder Jian Shengdong!” The three other grand elders of the Jian Family revealed hopeful expressions when they noticed his arrival. </p>
			<p> The three of them went over to the thirteen God of Creation Realm experts and fell to their knees. </p>
			<p> Allowing them to get up, Jian Shengdong’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong’s group. He was slightly taken aback when he saw Tao Hang among them. He didn’t understand why a Dao Venerable was part of that group. </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, he had to get to the bottom of the matter. “Are you the one who killed the grand elders of my Jian Family?” Jian Shengdong growled. </p>
			<p> The experts behind him stared at Huang Xiaolong, waiting for his reply. </p>
			<p> “Did you bring enough money?” Huang Xiaolong replied with a question of his own. </p>
			<p> Everyone was shocked by his nonchalant attitude. </p>
			<p> “This brat… He’s still thinking about the money now!” One of the old ancestors of another family shook his head as he observed the situation in the hall. “If I were him, I'd start thinking about how I want to die…” </p>
			<p> “That might not be so. Since he dared to kill grand elders of the Jian Family, he has to possess some type of special status. His expression didn’t even change when he spoke to Jian Shengdong!” </p>
			<p> “Special status?” Lord Jian Wushuang had broken through the 20 billion mark. Other than Lords Ferocious Ghost, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen, no one will dare to go against the Jian Family! He obviously isn’t someone sent by the various Lords. Moreover, their relationship with Lord Jian Wushuang isn’t bad.” </p>
			<p> Discussion broke out in the surroundings. 𝑓𝑟𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸ℴ𝘮</p>
			<p> As Jian Shengdong stared at Huang Xiaolong, his brows furrowed together. A look of suspicion could be seen in his eyes. </p>
			<p> “Isn’t it just tens of billions of dao coins? You won’t be alive to spend it anyway…” One of the half-step Universe Gods beside Jian Shengdong sneered. “As long as you take a single strike from me, I’ll give you the money!” Sword qi filled the space around him as soon as he spoke.  </p>
			<p> Everyone was shocked by his sudden action. </p>
			<p> Before they could react, a ray of sword light shot towards Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t move as the sword light sank into his body. </p>
			<p> Staring at him in shock, everyone thought that the battle was over just like that! </p>
			<p> Jian Shengdong and the rest didn’t believe it either. </p>
			<p> “Lord Jian Chao is really strong indeed! I’m afraid ordinary half-step Universe Gods won’t be able to resist his sword qi either.” One of the old ancestors in the distance sighed. </p>
			<p> “Is that it?! Lord Jian Chao took care of it so easily! What a joke… I thought he had something to rely on when he acted so cockily. I was even waiting for a massive battle to take place! Hahaha! The kid is really something else. He challenged the prestige of the Jian Family when he couldn't even resist a single strike from Lord Jian Chao!” </p>
			<p> Everyone burst out laughing, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that something was wrong. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air, “I’m sorry, was that the strike you were talking about? It’s so weak I thought I mistook it for a breeze…” </p>
			<p> Weak?! </p>
			<p> Everyone who laughed stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. Was that it?!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3649: Personally Meet You</p>
			</title>
			<p>The faces of the eminent elders from the Jian Family changed. </p>
			<p>All of a sudden, a burst of sword qi came from Huang Xiaolong. It was countless times stronger that the sword qi Jian Chao formed earlier. Before anyone could react, the sword qi sank deep into Jian Chao’s body.</p>
			<p>As a half-step Universe God, there was absolutely no chance he could remain standing even if Huang Xiaolong unleashed a casual attack. As a miserable cry left his lips, he was flung out of the tea house and he crashed heavily into the streets.</p>
			<p>The experts along the streets jumped in fright.</p>
			<p>They weren’t the only ones who were shocked. The members of the Jian Family who came over to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson stared at him, dumbfounded. When his sword qi shot by them, they noticed that it was so quick they couldn’t react!</p>
			<p>Jian Shengdong’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p>
			<p>“You… You know Han’er?” Jian Shengdong asked slowly.</p>
			<p>Tao Hang stepped forward in response. “I am Tao Han’er’s foster father!” </p>
			<p>The crowd started to clamor the moment the words left his lips. </p>
			<p>“Han’er? The princess of the Jian Family, Tao Han’er? Is that for real?”</p>
			<p>“I heard that Princess Han’er was found in the Hengshan Mountain Range in the Qiankun Celestial Empire. Before she was found, she had been wandering the world for hundreds of thousands of years… It’s definitely possible that she has a foster father…” </p>
			<p>The news was too damn explosive!</p>
			<p>Jian Shengdong turned to look at Tao Hang with shock in his eyes.</p>
			<p>As one of the higher ups of the Jian Family, he knew that Tao Han’er had a foster father in the Limitless Lands. He never thought that they would be meeting in such a situation. Moreover, he never expected Tao Hang to arrive at the Zhu Lan Lands. After all, he was a mere Dao Venerable. There was no way he could cross the Nightless Sea to reach the Zhu Lan Lands.</p>
			<p>Hesitation filled his heart.</p>
			<p>“Lord Shengdong?” The other half-step Universe God asked carefully and the members of the Jian Family stared at their eminent elder.</p>
			<p>“How much?” Jian Shengdong finally broke the silence after a long time.</p>
			<p>Everyone gasped when they realized that Jian Shengdong was getting ready to pay the Zhu Family Tea House.</p>
			<p>Zhu Fei looked at the grand elder of the Zhu Family and the grand elder stuttered, “36… 36.8 billion and 93.21 million dao coins…”𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p>Reaching into his spatial artifact, Jian Shengdong realized that he only brought close to 10 billion with him. After all, none of them thought that they were actually going to pay the money.</p>
			<p>Jian Shengdong looked at the other eminent elders of the Jian Family. After they searched through their spatial artifacts, they took out the cash with much difficulty.</p>
			<p>After they were done, they went to pick up Jian Chao before leaving with their tails tucked between their legs.</p>
			<p>As for the three grand elders, they retrieved the bodies of the other two before following behind the God of Creation Realm experts on their side.</p>
			<p>Those standing around looked at each other in confusion. They clearly didn’t expect such an outcome.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>“What?! Jian Shengdong escaped?!” Zhu Jian exclaimed.</p>
			<p>Zhu Yun hesitated for a second before explaining, “When Jian Shengdong learned that the slave beside the brat was Tao Han’er’s foster father, he paid without a word and left with the experts of the Jian Family.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Zhu Jian’s face. “So… he let the brat go because of Han’er?” </p>
			<p>“Not really…” Zhu Yun lowered his head and muttered, “I heard that the kid defeated Jian Chao.”</p>
			<p>“The kid defeated a half-step Universe God of the Jian Family?!” Zhu Jian’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
			<p>“Yes. He used a single strand of sword qi to defeat the man...” Zhu Yun explained the situation to his young master.</p>
			<p>After learning that Huang Xiaolong not only took Jian Chao’s sword qi head on without suffering any injuries and defeated the half-step Universe God in one strike, his expression started to fluctuate. “That would mean that the kid is an expert who broke through the 10 billion units mark…”</p>
			<p>Zhu Yun raised his head to gauge Zhu Jian’s mood before replying, “That seems to be so…”</p>
			<p>Jian Chao might be a half-step Universe God, but he possessed extraordinary combat abilities. Even so, he failed to withstand a single strike from the kid!</p>
			<p>After learning of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, Zhu Jian’s expression turned extremely dark. “No wonder he dares to act all arrogant… Where’s my father?”</p>
			<p>Zhu Yun bowed, “Lord Mei Jie is currently exchanging pointers with Lord Jian Wushuang and Lord Gui Chi in the Jian Family!”</p>
			<p>“Tell me when he returns.” Zhu Jian growled.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Young Master!” </p>
			<p>After Jian Shengdong left the tea house, he returned to the Jian Family immediately. When they saw Jian Weifeng, he saw Jian Bifei whispering something into his ear.</p>
			<p>“Blue Dragon Young Master?!” A deep look appeared in Jian Weifeng’s eyes after hearing what his son said.</p>
			<p>Jian Shengdong and the rest wanted to make their report but they were interrupted by him. “I already know what happened in the tea house…”</p>
			<p>The news had long since spread around the city while Jian Shengdong was making his way back.</p>
			<p>From the part where Tao Han’er’s foster father was revealed to the world and Jian Chao was sent flying with a single strike… He heard everything.</p>
			<p>Jian Bifei continued, “Father, I also heard that the Blue Dragon Young Master has some sort of relationship with Yu Xiaohong!”  </p>
			<p>“Oh?” Jian Weifeng was slightly taken aback at the news. “Is that true?” </p>
			<p>“Yes. Yu Xiaohong managed to return from the Bewilderment Island and someone saw them together.” Jian Bifei bowed. “Looks like their relationship is pretty good. The two of them seem intimate with each other too!” </p>
			<p>“Intimate?” Killing intent raged in Jian Weifeng’s heart all of a sudden.</p>
			<p>Achieving his goal, a smile secretly formed on Jian Bifei’s face. </p>
			<p>“The brat injured me previously, and arrogantly declared that he would personally show up during the ceremony tomorrow.” Jian Bifei added.</p>
			<p>With his eyes narrowing, Jian Weifeng growled, “Alright, I’ll personally meet the kid tomorrow!” </p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>After Jian Shengdong and his men left, Huang Xiaolong returned to the courtyard to comprehend the sword manual.</p>
			<p>After the incident, the Zhu Family Tea House’s business boomed. </p>
			<p>The night passed eventually, and dawn broke. The ceremony was about to begin!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3650: You’re Here!</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Lord, the ceremony is about to begin…” Zhu Fei, Cao Dehong, and the others came to make their report.</p>
			<p>Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong kept the sword manual.</p>
			<p>“Let’s go! To the Jian Family!” </p>
			<p>“Jian Family!” </p>
			<p>As the ceremony was to congratulate Jian Wushuang on breaking through, the venue was naturally set in the main palace of the Jian Family.</p>
			<p>Those who received invitations to the ceremony were definitely experts in the God of Creation Realm.</p>
			<p>As the old ancestors brought their juniors onto their flying ships and headed for the Jian Family, the skies above the entrance of the Jian Family filled up in an instant!</p>
			<p>“Elder Baixuan Tian has arrived!”</p>
			<p>An expert of the Jian Family yelled as a massive white colored flying ship tore through the skies. </p>
			<p>A commotion broke out in the crowd as experts stopped wherever they were. A huge passage formed along the gates.</p>
			<p>“Elder Baixuan Tian has been in seclusion for countless years! She chose to show up this time!” </p>
			<p>“Lord Jian Wushuang breaking through the 20 billion units mark is the greatest thing that has happened in our Unknown Lands since a long time ago! It’s nothing odd for Elder Baixuan Tian to come!” </p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian had close to 19.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy! Before Jian Wushuang broke through, he stood at the same level as Baixuan Tian and Gui Chi!</p>
			<p>There were dozens of experts in the Unknown Lands with 19 billion units of combat strength. Gui Chi, Baixuan Tian, and Jian Wushuang were the most famous of them all.</p>
			<p>Under the terrified gazes of those present, The giant white flying ship stopped. The entrance opened and a silver haired grandma walked out. She was clad in pure white robes and she held a wooden staff in her hand. The pupils in her eyes were so small that her eyes seemed completely white.</p>
			<p>The ceremony held by the Jian Family was supposed to be festive. Experts who arrived would wear ceremonial robes. Not many people would dare to wear all white as that was usually worn during funerals. Even so, no one dared to say a word about Elder Baixuan Tian’s sense of fashion.</p>
			<p>Many experts bowed instinctively when she strolled past.</p>
			<p>Behind her were countless beauties also clad in white. All of them were great beauties and they caught the attention of the men of the younger generation.</p>
			<p>One of them could shock the world with her beauty, but there was an entire group of them! Their appearance could cause the world to shake.</p>
			<p>“It’s our Jian Family’s honor to receive Elder Baixuan Tian!” Jian Weifeng arrived at the entrance of the Jian Family out of nowhere and he cupped his fists to welcome the elder.</p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian nodded slightly.</p>
			<p>The group was led into the Jian Family by Jian Weifeng personally. </p>
			<p>He chuckled happily as they made their way in, “Elder Tian, my father is currently in the main hall with Lord Gui Chi and Lord Mei Jie. That is why I came to welcome Elder Tian. Please do not be offended.”</p>
			<p>“Oh? That old freak Gui Chi came?” Elder Baixuan Tian raised an eyebrow slightly. </p>
			<p>“Lord Gui Chi arrived two days ago. After all, the Heavenly Peak is about to open soon. Lord Gui Chi plans on having a go at it.” Jian Weifeng explained.</p>
			<p>“Time really flies… The Heavenly Peak is about to open again!” Elder Baixuan Tian sighed.</p>
			<p>Only after Jian Weifeng and Baixuan Tian disappeared did the experts at the entrance straighten their bodies.</p>
			<p>In the crowd, Kong Fanxing, a member of the younger generation of the Kong Family asked Kong Shao, the old ancestor of the Kong Family, “Ancestor, Elder Baixuan Tian looks really friendly and nice. Why is everyone so afraid of her?” </p>
			<p>A solemn expression hung on Kong Shao’s face and he explained, “You’re not qualified to discuss anything about Elder Baixuan Tian!” </p>
			<p>“Yes… I was wrong!” Kong Fanxing sighed half heartedly.</p>
			<p>Seeing as his grandson wasn’t taking his words seriously, Kong Shao continued, “There was a half-step Universe God who started talking behind Elder Baixuan Tian’s back after she left, saying that her eyes were really special. Elder Baixuan Tian heard it and destroyed his physical body completely. She cripplied his dao veins and shattered his dao heart. She even captured his dao soul. It’s said that to this day, his dao soul is being tortured in Elder Baixuan Tian’s cultivation cave.”</p>
			<p>The blood drained from Kong Fanxing’s face instantly.</p>
			<p>Just as the Kong Family were about to step through the entrance of the Jian Family, a pretty little lady emerged from the entrance. She was extremely cute, and many female disciples of the Jian Family followed closely behind her.</p>
			<p>“Second Resurrection Dao Venerable Realm?” Kong Fanxing was shocked.</p>
			<p>There was no way a cultivator at her level should be allowed into the ceremony!</p>
			<p>Kong Shao seemed to have thought of something and he quickly brought the members of his family to the side. When Kong Fanxing was still confused, Kong Shao’s voice rang the mind of the members of the Kong Family. “If I’m not mistaken, this is Princess Tao Han’er of the Jian Family!” </p>
			<p>“What?!” </p>
			<p>Princess Tao Han’er managed to catch the eye of Lord Jian Wushuang and she has a high chance of becoming his successor! </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er arrived at the entrance of the Jian Family Palace and she stared into the air, as though she was waiting for someone. </p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing couldn’t help but gasp, “Is Princess Tao Han’er waiting to welcome someone?! Who’s worthy enough for her to come out personally?” </p>
			<p>Kong Shao continued, “She has a foster father and she seems to really admire some guy called the Blue Dragon Young Master. She’s probably waiting for them!” </p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing felt a sour feeling in his heart after hearing that the princess of the Jian Family admired another man. He couldn’t help but ask, “Who is the Blue Dragon Young Master?”</p>
			<p>Glancing at Kong Fanxing from the corner of his eye, Kong Shao snapped, “You better not be comparing yourself to him. Haven’t you heard what happened in the Zhu Family Tea House yesterday?” </p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing nodded slowly. He heard bits and pieces of it, but he didn’t get a full idea of what had happened. Could the deaths of the grand elders of the Jian Family have something to do with the Blue Dragon Young Master?</p>
			<p>Could it be?!𝒇𝒓𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>“Yeah… He killed them.” Kong Shao noticed the expression on his grandson’s face and he continued, “He killed them because they refused to pay several tens of billions…”</p>
			<p>“Because of that?!” Kong Fanxing nearly jumped in fright.</p>
			<p>“That’s not all. It was said that Jian Weifeng flew into a rage and sent Jian Shengdong over to deal with the matter. Jian Chao and several other experts followed Jian Shengdong and when they got to the tea house…” He stopped abruptly when he noticed the change in Tao Han’er’s expression. </p>
			<p>An expression of joy formed on her face as she rushed towards a group of newcomers. “Lord Huang! Father! You’re here!” </p>

			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong slowly made his way over, and smiled when he saw Tao Han’er jumping up and down at the entrance of the Jian Family. “You don’t need to come all the way out here… We won’t get lost in such a small place!” </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er ran over to Huang Xiaolong and grinned, “I was afraid that you guys would be stopped at the entrance! After all, you might not have gotten an invitation!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Tao Hang and laughed, “If they do, we’ll use your great name to enter the palace!”</p>
			<p>Tao Hang grinned, “Lord Huang is right!”</p>
			<p>Pouting slightly, Tao Han’er complained, “All of you are bullying me! Hmph!” She then turned to Huang Xiaolong and muttered, “Lord Huang, let’s go! The ceremony should be starting soon!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded and entered the Jian Family Palace with Zhu Fei, Cao Dehong, and the rest.</p>
			<p>With Tao Han’er present, none of the disciples dared to stop Huang Xiaolong’s group. Of course, not stopping them was one thing. Making a report to the higher ups was another. They quickly sent out reports to Jian Bifei the moment Huang Xiaolong entered.</p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing asked his grandfather after looking at Tao Han’er’s reaction. “Ancestor, how did they get to know each other?” </p>
			<p>“I heard that Princess Tao Han’er and her foster father were saved by the Blue Dragon Young Master back in the Limitless Land. From then on, they started to follow him. That is why she calls the Blue Dragon Young Master her lord…” Kong Shao explained. </p>
			<p>“So that’s the case…” Kong Fanxing muttered, “The Blue Dragon Young Master is pretty lucky…”</p>
			<p>Chuckling slightly, Kong Shao brought the members of the Kong Family into the palace.</p>
			<p>“Ancestor, you stopped at the part where Jian Shengdong brough the members of the Jian Family into the tea house. What happened after that?” Kong Fanxing pestered. “Did the Blue Dragon Young Master bring out their connection to Princess Tao Han’er for Jian Shengdong to let them off?”</p>
			<p>“No.” Kong Shao muttered softly.</p>
			<p>No?!</p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing was taken aback slightly.</p>
			<p>“When Lord Jian Shengdong, Jian Chao, and the others arrived at the tea house, the Blue Dragon Young Master enraged them and they moved against him. Lord Jian Chao summoned his sword qi and managed to stab the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Kong Shao explained.</p>
			<p>“No way… The Blue Dragon Young Master doesn’t look injured at all!” Kong Fanxing gasped.</p>
			<p>“That’s because he isn’t. It’s said that after taking the strike, he didn’t suffer the slightest injury. He even said that Jiao Chao’s sword qi is as weak as a breeze… He summoned his own sword qi and sent Lord Jiao Chao flying. It’s said that he only allowed them to live because of Tao Han’er.”</p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing’s jaws dropped.</p>
			<p>Eminent Elder Jian Chao of the Jian Family, a half-step Universe God, was defeated in one move! How strong did his opponent have to be?!</p>
			<p>“What happened next?” Kong Fanxing pressed.𝓯𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝒃𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>“Lord Jian Shengdong obediently paid up after collecting all the money they had. They brought Lord Jian Chao back to the Jian Family.” Kong Shao said in a strange tone.</p>
			<p>By this time, massive waves were battering against Kong Fanxing’s tiny little heart. </p>
			<p>Lord Jian Shengdong, an expert who broke through the 10 billion units mark, was an existence akin to a god in their eyes! Even so, he couldn’t compare to the Blue Dragon Young Master!</p>
			<p>“But… I also heard that he has some sort of dubious relationship with Yu Xiaohong.” Kong Shao whispered.</p>
			<p>“What?! Are you talking about Lord Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire?!”</p>
			<p>“Yep…” Kong Shao nodded. “Everyone in the Zhu Lan Land knows that Lord Jian Weifeng has something for her! Now that rumors are spreading about the Blue Dragon Young Master’s relationship with Yu Xiaohong, he won’t be able to leave the palace in one piece!” </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, another voice rang through the air. “The Limitless Master has arrived!”</p>
			<p>“The King of the Ocean Race in the Nightless Sea has arrived!” </p>
			<p>Kong Shao was shocked and he muttered to himself, “Their relationship with the Jian Family isn’t anything special… Why are they here?!” </p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing analyzed the situation and replied, “They’re probably here to kiss up to Lord Jian Wushuang after hearing that he broke through.” </p>
			<p>Kong Shao nodded. It was definitely possible.</p>
			<p>A huge group of experts came in the distance, and the two of them who led the way were Wu Xin and Ye Ye.</p>
			<p>Behind them, more than ten thousand experts of the Limitless Lands and the Ocean Race could be seen. All of them were God of Creation Realm experts!</p>
			<p>Shock filled everyone who arrived. What type of formation was this?! If Jian Wushuang hadn’t broken through and was recognized as the sixth strongest individual of the Unknown Lands, they would have thought that Wu Xin and Ye Ye were there to declare war on the Jian Family!</p>
			<p>Who the hell brought over ten thousand experts over to offer some congratulations?!</p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing felt his scalp going numb when he saw the newcomers. The expression of those who had already entered changed as well. </p>
			<p>“Looks like something big is about to go down…” Kong Shao frowned. </p>
			<p>“Ancestor, do you think that they’re here to mess with the Jian Family? That is not possible, right? Lord Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion mark! Who will dare to mess with them?” Kong Fanxing gasped.</p>
			<p>Indeed… No matter how strong the Limitless Lands and the Ocean Race were, they would be kicking a steel board if they came to look for trouble!</p>
			<p>After all, most of the people who attended the ceremony were friends with the Jian Family! The experts present were comparable to the amount brought by Wu Xin and Ye Ye!</p>
			<p>Kong Shao shook his head and tried to clear his mind. “No… There’s something off here.”</p>
			<p>No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t put his finger on the weird feeling in his chest.</p>
			<p>Very quickly, Wu Xin and Ye Ye arrived.</p>
			<p>“Lord Limitless, Your Majesty, according to our rules, everyone can only bring ten people with them.” The disciple guarding the entrance gathered his courage before speaking to the two of them. Of course, he didn’t forget his manners.</p>
			<p>Wu Xin and Ye Ye nodded casually before randomly picking ten people to follow them in. The rest remained outside.</p>
			<p>Just as they had entered the palace, another announcement rang through the air. “Her Majesty, Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire has arrived!” </p>

				<p>Chapter 3652: Not Worthy?</p>
			</title>
			<p>As everyone turned to look in the distance, a shockingly beautiful woman approached the palace. Behind her were more than a hundred experts at the God of Creation Realm!</p>
			<p>She was none other than Yu Xiaohong, the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!</p>
			<p>Even though she had been trapped on the Bewilderment Island for countless years and her reputation was no longer as resounding, everyone knew that she was a supreme expert who had more than 14 billion units of combat strength! One had to know that there were hardly any female cultivators in the Unknown Lands who could break through the 10 billion units mark.</p>
			<p>Her appearance caused a commotion to ripple through the crowd. It was no less than when Wu Xin and Ye Ye brought over so many God of Creation Realm experts… After all, everyone present knew that Patriarch Jian Weifeng had been rejected twice by her.</p>
			<p>Kong Shao looked at Yu Xiaohong and the uneasy feeling in his heart grew stronger. “She shouldn’t be here…” </p>
			<p>“Ancestor, what’s wrong?” Kong Fanxing asked.</p>
			<p>“Yu Xiaohong’s relationship with Jian Weifeng has never been good. According to logic, she wouldn’t bother coming over to attend their ceremony. Also, she injured Jian Xiyuan, Jian Chengfeng, and robbed the Unparalleled Sword Manual from them not too long ago. Isn’t she asking for trouble by showing up?”</p>
			<p>“She injured Jian Xiyuan?!” Kong Fanxing gasped. “She even robbed the Unparalleled Sword Manual of the Jian Family!” </p>
			<p>“I heard that Lord Jian Wushuang flew into rage when he learned of it. He planned to deal with the Xiaohong Celestial Empire after the ceremony. Who would have thought that she would send herself over?” Kong Shao sighed. </p>
			<p>Kong Fanxing guessed, “Is it possible she came to apologize to Lord Jian Wushuang? She might have regretted her actions after obtaining Lord Jian Wushuang’s sword manual and plan to use the chance where he’s in a good mood to admit her mistakes. He might just let her off the hook.”</p>
			<p>Kong Shao couldn’t think of any way to refute that and he sighed, “Perhaps…”</p>
			<p>However, was that really the case? </p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng was also taken aback when he heard her arrival.</p>
			<p>“Patriarch, do you think she came over to apologize to the old ancestor?” Jian Chao laughed.</p>
			<p>A weird light flashed in Jian Weifeng’s eyes but a flash of joy soon appeared in them. “Let’s hope so…”</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong frowned when he heard the two announcements. “What are they here for? Do they want to join in the fun or something?” </p>
			<p>He naturally referred to Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong.</p>
			<p>Cao Dehong chuckled at the side, “Lord Wu Xin and Lord Ye Ye probably can’t rest easy when they learned that you were coming to the Jian Family…” </p>
			<p>“Me? What do they have to worry about?!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦𝑤𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p>“Who is Lord Wu Xin and Lord Ye Ye?” Tao Han’er asked all of a sudden. Not many people knew their true names, and it wasn’t a surprise that Tao Han’er was confused.</p>
			<p>“Lord Huang, shall I bring you to look for my old ancestor now?” Tao Han’er asked.</p>
			<p>“Jian Wushuang? Why would you need to bring me to meet him?” Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrow slightly and nearly burst out laughing.</p>
			<p>“You… You killed two grand elders of the family yesterday! The old ancestor flew into a rage when he heard about it. Lord Huang, if you apologize to him, he should forgive you…” Tao Han’er lowered her head and whispered.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong couldn’t control his laughter anymore. “Are you afraid that I won’t be able to beat him?” </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er thought for a second before nodding her head seriously. “Yeah… He broke through the 20 billion units mark and his sword dao reached the universe level. Other than the five overlords of the Unknown Lands, no one is his opponent! Even though Lord Huang is strong, you… You might not be able to defeat him… Lord Huang, you don’t know this, but Ancestor Wushuang showed me the power of his universe level sword dao! He slashed through the void with a single slash! Not even Uncle Weifeng could see the limit of his strike!”</p>
			<p>“Universe-level sword dao?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow slightly.</p>
			<p>It had to be pretty strong if Jian Weifeng failed to see its limits.</p>
			<p>“Yeah!” Tao Han’er nodded solemnly. “If I manage to become half as strong as Ancestor Wushuang, that would be great!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong smiled and said half-jokingly, “Alright! I’ll have a taste of his sword dao later to experience it for myself!” </p>
			<p>Falling silent for a moment, Tao Han’er muttered to herself, “Alright… I’ll tell Ancestor Wushuang to control himself…”</p>
			<p>Laughter left Huang Xiaolong’s lips and he didn’t continue talking about it.</p>
			<p>As the few of them arrived outside the main hall, Jian Bifei arrived. He stopped Huang Xiaolong and the rest.</p>
			<p>“Big Brother Bifei, what are you doing?” Tao Han’er snapped.</p>
			<p>“Little Sister Han’er, you might not know, but only those who received our invitation will be able to enter the inner hall. All of them were invited by Ancestor Wushuang himself. Moreover, Lord Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, the Limitless Master, the King of the Ocean Race, and several other supreme experts are in there right now. If you offend them by bringing in so many people, Ancestor Wushuang might get angry! I’m not letting you in in case you offend the old ancestor!” Jian Bifei added.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er started to hesitate. She turned to Huang Xiaolong and said, “Lord Huang, Father, why don’t you wait for me out here for some time? I’ll go in and talk to our old ancestor to tell him about your arrival!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded as he didn’t wish to put Tao Han’er on the spot. He found a random seat with the others. </p>
			<p>Those who could enter the inner hall were experts who had broken through the 10 billion units mark. Those sitting in the outer hall were experts who were half-step Universe Gods or Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. There were also several individuals of the younger generation.</p>
			<p>When the experts around saw Huang Xiaolong sitting down, they retreated to the side in case they were associated with him.</p>
			<p>“Is he the Blue Dragon Young Master who killed two grand elders of the Jian Family?” </p>
			<p>“Heh, he dares to show his face here. I heard that Jian Weifeng has already sworn to kill him the moment the ceremony ends!”</p>
			<p>“He’s familiar with Princess Han’er and she should plead on his behalf…”</p>
			<p>“If Jian Weifeng is hell bent on killing him, even Princess Han’er won’t be able to save him…” </p>
			<p>Their discussion entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears, but he couldn’t be bothered with them. Naturally, all of them thought that he wouldn’t be able to do anything to them since they were in the Jian Family.</p>
			<p>“That brat… He’s just a toad lusting over swan’s meat. Princess Han’er is definitely going to inherit Lord Jian Wushuang’s sword dao in the future. He’s overestimating himself!” </p>
			<p>“That’s right! Weren’t there rumors of him getting close to Lord Yu Xiaohong? What a shameless man! How can someone like that be associated with Princess Han’er?”</p>
			<p>The more they spoke, the angrier Cao Dehong and the rest became. In a fit of rage, Cao Dehong and the others got to their feet.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3653: How Dare You!</p>
			</title>
			<p>As soon as they did, the experts who were cursing at Huang Xiaolong earlier seemed to have fallen under some sort of curse. They yelped once before rolling about on the floor. Every time they opened their mouths from then on, they would insult the members of the Jian Family. </p>
			<p>They roared that the Jian Family was despicable and Jian Weifeng was a hypocrite. The words that came out of their mouths were nasty.</p>
			<p>The experts in the outer hall stared at each other in shock.</p>
			<p>After scolding Huang Xiaolong, the two of them lost their minds. No one would believe it if Huang Xiaolong said that he had nothing to do with them.</p>
			<p>Everyone recognized the two experts who were rolling around the ground. One of them was the old ancestor of the Xu Family of the Zhu Lan Lands, and the other was the old ancestor of the Hao Family. Both of them were Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage.</p>
			<p>The Xu Family and Wu Family were vassals of the Jian Family. They were extremely loyal to Jian Weifeng, but now, they were reduced to a crazed mess. Everyone felt goosebumps growing all over their arms.</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng heard the report about the two of them going crazy and his expression sank. “Take the two of them down and throw them out of the outer hall.”𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p>Jian Shengdong acknowledged before leaving to carry out the order.</p>
			<p>“Patriarch, the Blue Dragon Young Master definitely has something to do with them going crazy…” Jian Xiyuan growled. “Why don’t I head out and deal with that kid?”  </p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng shook his head slowly. “The ceremony is about to start. Let’s not mess things up. We’ll wait for the ceremony to end before dealing with the kid. He can thank his lucky stars that I’m allowing him to live for a few more hours.”</p>
			<p>Jian Xuyuan sighed and nodded.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, Tao Han’er entered the hall. Shw bowed towards Jian Weifeng and said, “Uncle, I need to speak to Ancestor Wushuang.” </p>
			<p>The inner hall was large, and Jian Wushuang sat in the middle of the hall with Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Mei Jie.</p>
			<p>The other experts could only sit at the side of the hall.</p>
			<p>Seeing that the person who had spoken was Tao Han’er, Jian Weifeng forced a smile, “Han’er, the ancestor is discussing the dao with the other lords. Don’t interrupt them. You can tell me everything you wish to say.”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er hesitated slightly before speaking, “I wish to bring the Blue Dragon Young Master into the hall to apologize to Ancestor Wushuang.”</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng’s expression sank instantly. “Enough. Stop interfering with the matters regarding the Blue Dragon Young Master.” </p>
			<p>Looking at her reluctant expression, he added quickly, “We’ll deal with the matter after the ceremony ends. Go to your seat quietly.”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er lowered her head and walked slowly towards a seat in the hall. It was coincidentally located right beside Zhu Jian. </p>
			<p>When she sat down, Zhu Jian got up and walked over to her. “Younger Sister Han’er!” </p>
			<p>His voice was sickly sweet, but it sounded extremely harsh on her ears. With her mood already dampened from what Jian Weifeng said, she ignored him and sat down sullenly.</p>
			<p>Zhu Jian’s body stiffened, but he quickly reacted. He walked towards the center of the hall and kneeled before Jian Wushuang. “Lord Jian Wushuang, I have fallen in love with Younger Sister Han’er the moment I met her. I can’t think of anything but her. Today, I hope Lord Jian Wushuang will agree to my proposal and allow me to marry her!” </p>
			<p>He kowtowed once, and a sincere expression stuck to his face.</p>
			<p>Due to the sudden interruption, Jian Wushuang was slightly taken aback.</p>
			<p>Mei Jie got to his feet all of a sudden. He laughed, “Brother Wushuang, you might not know, but this kid has been talking about her. He’s been pestering me to raise the proposal on his behalf, but who would have thought that he would do it himself? I hope brother Wushuang can agree to the marriage!” </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er started to panic. She couldn’t understand the sudden change in the situation!</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang chuckled lightly in response, “Brother Mei Jie, there’s no need to act so awkwardly around me. This is great! Zhu Jian possesses unquestionable talent! His personality is pretty good too! The two kids are a couple made in heaven! However, the two of them are still weak. It’s too early to talk about marriage…”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er heaved a sigh of relief when she heard what he said.</p>
			<p>However, Mei Jie didn’t let up. “Their cultivation won’t hamper things. Why don’t we set the engagement now? As soon as they break through to the God of Creation Realm, they can have their wedding ceremony!” </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang stroked his beard and laughed, “That seems alright! Since that’s the case, we’ll set it at that!” </p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian laughed at the side, “Today, you’re holding a ceremony to celebrate your breakthrough. Now that the marriage is set, it’s another thing we get to congratulate you on! I give my best wishes to Brother Mei Jie and Brother Wushuang!” </p>
			<p>Laughter filled the air.</p>
			<p>However, their joy was broken when Tao Han’er got to her feet and yelled, “I don’t agree to this!” </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrow and his laughter continued, “Han’er, Young Master Zhu Jian is extremely talented! His status in the Zhu Lan Lands isn’t low either. There’s nothing wrong with marrying him!” </p>
			<p>Tears filled her eyes as she continued to argue, “I’m not going to get married!” </p>
			<p>“This brat… You can’t remain single your whole life. Enough. This shall be done.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.</p>
			<p>Even though she felt extremely wronged, she couldn’t go against Jian Wushuang. She could only cry silently. </p>
			<p>All of a sudden, a calm voice boomed in the hall, “Old man Wushuang, you don’t get to make decisions for Han’er.”</p>
			<p>The experts in the hall raised their heads with their mouths agape.</p>
			<p>Old Man Wushuang?!</p>
			<p>They turned to look at the entrance of the inner hall to see the maniac who dared to address Jian Wushuang that way. </p>
			<p>They saw a young man strolling into the hall with his hands clasped behind his back.</p>
			<p>It was none other than Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>When Gui Chi saw who it was, his eyebrows jumped.</p>
			<p>“What audacity!” Jian Xiyuan roared. “How dare you show disrespect to our old ancestor?! You deserve death!” </p>
			<p>As soon as he spoke, his sword qi surrounded him as rays of light filled the hall. </p>
			<p>“Good technique!” Mei Jie praised all of a sudden.</p>
			<p>Before Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi could strike Huang Xiaolong, he released his aura. A heaven-shaking pressure filled the hall and the ground shook violently.</p>
			<p>Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi exploded. Eminent Elder Jian Xiyuan had 13 billion units of combat strength, but he failed to do a thing to the intruder! Huang Xiaolong didn’t even move to stop Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi!</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Jian Wushuang was also taken aback.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, Wu Xin and Ye Ye started to approach him.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3654: Greetings, Master!</p>
			</title>
			<p>Those in the hall stared in stunned silence when they saw Wu Xin and Ye Ye approaching Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Patriarch, looks like the kid is too arrogant! Even the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Races can’t take it anymore! They’re going to get rid of him!” Jian Shengdong laughed. </p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng joined him. “Lord Wu Xin and Ye Ye look like they plan to please our old ancestor. They will definitely be ruthless in their actions!”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er yelled anxiously when she saw the two of them approach. “Lord Huang, run away! Don’t worry about me!” </p>
			<p>When everyone was ready to watch them beat the sh*t out of Huang Xiaolong, the two of them bowed respectfully. “Subordinate greets Lord Huang!”</p>
			<p>Loud blasts rang in the heads of those sitting around.</p>
			<p>Subordinates?!</p>
			<p>Lord?!!</p>
			<p>Even with their status, Wu Xin and Ye Ye were mere subordinates?! </p>
			<p>There were countless experts in the inner hall who fell to their buttocks.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie got to their feets.</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng who was ready to watch Huang Xiaolong get beaten up by the two of them felt his body freezing up.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er was equally as shocked.</p>
			<p>What in the world was going on?!</p>
			<p>How did the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race turn into his subordinates?!</p>
			<p>When everyone was stuck in a state of shock, Yu Xiaohong appeared from the outer hall and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong, “This subordinates greet Lord Huang!” </p>
			<p>Another one!</p>
			<p>This time, it was the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the three of them and frowned. “Who told you to come?!”</p>
			<p>The three of them jumped in fright when they noticed the displeasure in his voice.</p>
			<p>“We… We were worried about you!” Wu Xin whispered softly as though he was a kid who had done something wrong.</p>
			<p>“So… The three of you thought that you could come over and protect me?” Huang Xiaolong grunted, “Do you think I need you to protect me?!” </p>
			<p>The three of them fell to their knees in fright. </p>
			<p>“We didn’t think so far! Your Highness, please forgive us!” They knelt quickly.</p>
			<p>The old ancestors in the hall gasped in fright at the scene.</p>
			<p>The Limitless Master, the King of the Ocean Race, and the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire were acting so subserviently to him!</p>
			<p>All of them were supreme experts who controlled a massive power!</p>
			<p>The hall fell into silence instantly. </p>
			<p>All they could hear were the breaths and heartbeat coming from those around them. Jian Weifeng had it the worst as he felt his legs cramping up.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s expression softened eventually and he sighed, “Get up.” </p>
			<p>The three of them thanked him before getting to their feet.</p>
			<p>After they did, they stood behind him quietly.</p>
			<p>No one in the inner hall dared to speak a word. No one knew if they were dumbfounded by the scene where the three experts kneeled before Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A soft cough broke the silence in the hall. Gui Chi cupped his fist towards Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, we meet again.” The smile on his face was as bright as the sun. The members in the hall swore that they had never seen such an expression on Gui Chi’s face for as long as they had known him. Even when he met Jian Wushuang, he didn’t smile so brightly. </p>
			<p>Those who didn’t know would think that Gui Chi and Huang Xiaolong were close friends.</p>
			<p>Meeting again? When Huang Xiaolong chased him away back then, it couldn’t be considered a meeting, right? But whatever the case was, Huang Xiaolong replied casually, “I guess we meet again. You should have left the Zhu Lan Lands after you ran away from my sword qi. You shouldn’t have come to the Jian Family’s ceremony.”</p>
			<p>Storms raged in the hearts of those who heard it.</p>
			<p>What in the world did he just say?! Lord Gui Chi was chased away by the Blue Dragon Young Master’s sword qi!</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng felt his legs giving way.</p>
			<p>As for Jian Xiyuan who was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong earlier, he retreated to a corner of the hall. That was the only way he would feel safer.</p>
			<p>The expressions of Jian Wushuang, Elder Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie changed.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi’s strength placed him firmly into the ten strongest individuals of the Unknown Lands! He was close to the 20 billion units mark, but he was chased away by the other party’s sword qi! Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong was comparable to Jian Wushuang?!</p>
			<p>Zhu Jian tugged slightly on his father’s sleeves and he muttered, “Father…” </p>
			<p>“There’s no need to be afraid. I’m here.” An awkward expression formed on his face after the words left his lips. If the Blue Dragon Young Master could chase Gui Chi away, his strength would seem a little lacking to say the least.</p>
			<p>“Nevermind, grandpa’s reputation should be enough…” </p>
			<p>When Zhu Chen was brought up, Zhu Jian finally calmed himself down. </p>
			<p>Gui Chi grinned, “Lord, you’re right! I shouldn’t have come to the Jian Family. I’ll leave right now!” </p>
			<p>The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, he felt that something was wrong.</p>
			<p>His figure started to fade when Huang Xiaolong flipped his wrist. Gui Chi was forced back into his original position.</p>
			<p>“Lord… What… What is the meaning of this?” Gui Chi’s expression changed.𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>“Nothing much. Today, no one is allowed to leave without my explicit permission!” Huang Xiaolong snorted.</p>
			<p>Looks of disgust formed on the faces of those in the hall.</p>
			<p>“Hmph! What arrogance!” Elder Baixuan Tian’s expression sank. “Do you really think that you can keep all of us here?! Do you dare to declare war on the entire Unknown Lands?!”</p>
			<p>Even though not ever power in the Unknown Lands had shown up, most would have sent their respective envoys. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Huang Xiaolong’s actions would offend the entire Unknown Lands.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong glanced at her from the corner of his eye and spoke casually, “You’ll know if I have the ability to do it soon. So what if I declare war on the Unknown Lands? What do you think you can do to me?” </p>
			<p>Inhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang stepped forward and spoke, “I am Jian Wushuang and I hope to exchange pointers with fellow cultivator.”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3655: Jian Wushuang’s Sword Dao</p>
			</title>
			<p>Seeing as Jian Wushuang had stepped up, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er was the only one in the audience who started to panic. Stepping between Jian Wushang and Huang Xiaolong, she cried, “Lord Huang, Grandpa, don’t do this! There’s no need to resort to violence!” </p>
			<p>“Han’er, it’s alright. I’ll experience your grandpa’s sword dao and exchange some pointers with him.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang smiled too. “Fellow Cultivator Blue Dragon is right. Han’er, step back. We know when to stop.”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er could only return to her seat quietly.</p>
			<p>Everyone else in the hall retreated to the side too. Those who were weaker ran all the way out. For experts like Jian Wushuang to take action, every single shockwave due to the exchange had the ability to wipe them out of existence. </p>
			<p>Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong also went to a corner of the hall.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi, Mie Jie, and Elder Baixuan Tian retreated to the other side of the hall and stood beside each other.</p>
			<p>“Lord Gui Chi, who do you think will win?” Mei Jie asked.  </p>
			<p>Gui Chi didn’t say a word and a somber expression hung on his face.</p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian replied in his place, “Brother Wushuang’s sword dao had reached an unfathomable level. We can’t begin to comprehend the abilities he possesses. He will definitely come out victorious!” </p>
			<p>Gui Chi continued to remain silent as he cursed in his heart. So what if his sword dao is strong?! So what if he understands the way of the sword?! Nothing matters if the other party is much stronger! He can just bulldoze his way to victory!</p>
			<p>Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong and Jian Wushuang and sighed. Obviously, he hoped that Jian Wushuang would win! But from the looks of it…</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang made his move all of a sudden! No one saw how he did it. Not even Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, or Mei Jie! </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang’s sword couldn’t be described. It seemed like the sword he was using had encompassed the entire universe. </p>
			<p>The dao souls of everyone in the city felt a terrifying sword qi hovering around them, but they couldn’t pinpoint its location!</p>
			<p>Even so, they were sure that it was present!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could tell that Jian Wushuang’s sword qi was expanding endlessly. It was as though it had turned into the universe itself. He was like a tiny little creature hovering in space, ready to be killed by the sword qi.</p>
			<p>Of course, that was before he showed his strength.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, a terrifying pressure descended on the lands as Huang Xiaolong’s three great worlds started to spin.</p>
			<p>When Jian Wushuang’s sword qi arrived, a massive explosion ensued.</p>
			<p>It was as though the world was ending as the river of time threatened to split apart.</p>
			<p>Even though the exchange happened in the blink of an eye, everyone felt that they had taken a trip through time and space. </p>
			<p>Was that what it meant to possess a sword dao at the universe level?</p>
			<p>Indeed. That was Jian Wushuang’s sword dao. It had exceeded the confines of the universe laws.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang’s sword seemed to come from the universe origin and it went on forever.</p>
			<p>The light around Huang Xiaolong’s body was broken and his body trembled slightly. After some time, the sword qi started to fade.</p>
			<p>The space around the hall returned to normal and everyone came back to reality.</p>
			<p>When they looked at Huang Xiaolong, they saw him stepping back slightly.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi and the others sucked in a cold breath. They could tell how terrifying the strike was. If they were in his place, they would have died a million times over! Not even their dao souls would have survived!</p>
			<p>However, the man they call the Blue Dragon Young Master only retreated slightly!</p>
			<p>What shocked them the most wasn’t that. Instead…</p>
			<p>“Three great worlds!” </p>
			<p>They discovered that Huang Xiaolong was an existence with three great worlds!</p>
			<p>With his grand cosmos energy, he blocked Jian Wushuang’s strongest attack with brute force!</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang stared at Huang Xiaolong with a horrified expression. He was also frightened by the discovery that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds!</p>
			<p>“Your universe level sword dao is strong indeed… Too bad you can’t break through my defense.” Huang Xiaolong addressed Jian Wushuang directly without caring about the reaction of those in the hall.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had to admit that Jian Wushuang was strong. However, technique was nothing in the face of pure strength!</p>
			<p>The difference in their strength was too large!𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang’s expression fell and he seemed to age a lot. “Indeed… I have lost.” </p>
			<p>“No. You didn’t lose.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. </p>
			<p>In terms of sword dao, Jian Wushuang was the undeniable winner of the battle! After all, Huang Xiaolong’s sword dao was nothing compared to the man!</p>
			<p>With a complicated expression on his face, Jian Wushuang continued, “It doesn’t matter how you put it. I have lost.” </p>
			<p>He naturally knew the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words. However, the exchange between experts depended on strength! The winner was king! </p>
			<p>Indeed… Jian Wushuang had lost!</p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t make a move, Jian Wushuang couldn’t break through the other party’s defenses with his strongest attack! There was no point in fighting any more!</p>
			<p>When everyone was still flabbergasted by the outcome, Huang Xialong walked towards Mei Jie and Zhu Jian.</p>
			<p>Their hearts skipped a beat when Huang Xiaolong approached.</p>
			<p>“Father…” Zhu Jian held his father’s sleeves tightly as his legs threatened to give way.</p>
			<p>“Lord Blue Dragon, I am Mei Jie of the Zhu Family. My son offended you in the past but I hope that you can put it behind you on behalf of Lord Zhu Chen.” Mei Jie cupped his fists and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snorted in response, “Mei Jie, do you really not know who I am?” </p>
			<p>From the looks of things, Mei Jie didn’t seem to know who he was!</p>
			<p>Mei Jie was equally as stunned.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and Kun Feng, Kai Dong, and Xuan Hong appeared in the hall.</p>
			<p>“Kun Feng?! Kai Dong?! Xuan Hong?!” Mei Jie’s expression changed when he saw them.</p>
			<p>“Fourth brother!” The three of them rejoiced.</p>
			<p>“Fourth Brother, that’s Huang Xiaolong! He was the one who destroyed our Creation Palace!” The three of them yelled in unison.</p>
			<p>Evidently, they had no clue what was going on.</p>
			<p>They thought that Huang Xiaolong would release them because of Mei Jie’s interference.</p>
			<p>Mei Jie drew in a sharp breath and he looked at Huang Xiaolong before turning to the three of them.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3656: Severe Injuries</p>
			</title>
			<p>When Kun Feng and the rest thought that Mei Jie was there to seek justice on their behalf, Mei Jie bowed respectfully to Huang Xiaolong. “Lord Huang, I have long since left the Creation Palace. They have nothing to do with me. Right now, I am of the Zhu Family. Lord Huang, please understand that their fate has nothing to do with me.”</p>
			<p>Entered the Zhu Family! </p>
			<p>Their fates had nothing to do with him!</p>
			<p>Kun Feng and the others stared at him in shock and those in the hall stared at each other in stunned silence.</p>
			<p>However, his pleas seemed to have fallen of deaf ears as Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “I made a promise to Wang Meiqi to take revenge on her behalf. No matter what you say, I won’t let you off today.”</p>
			<p>Mei Jie’s expression changed instantly. However, he looked a little confused. “Wang Meiqi?” </p>
			<p>It was clear he didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong referred to.</p>
			<p>“Wang Meiqi of the Fantasy Butterfly Race, First Universe.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>“Fantasy Butterfly Race?!” Mei Jie gasped. One of the memories he had tried to bury resurfaced. </p>
			<p>Wang Meiqi!</p>
			<p>Unwilling to give up his life like that, Mei Jie continued, “I wonder what relationship Lord Huang has with Wang Meiqi? Are you willing to offend my Zhu Family because of a mere woman? Are you planning to infuriate the master of our Zhu Lan Lands?” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong flung his sleeve once and he chuckled, “Do you think I’ll be afraid of your Zhu Family? Zhu Chen isn’t powerful enough to make me think twice about my actions.” </p>
			<p>Mei Jie didn’t think that it was possible. Even though Huang Xiaolong blocked Jian Wushuang’s sword qi earlier, he still felt that Huang Xiaolong was some distance away from the other five overlords of the Unknown Lands.</p>
			<p>In his eyes, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could challenge Zhu Chen! The brat should be afraid of the old ancestor of the Zhu Family!</p>
			<p>From the words that came out of his mouth, it seemed as though… </p>
			<p>The faces of Jian Wushuang and the rest changed when they realized the meaning behind his words.</p>
			<p>Jian Weifeng felt the energy draining from his body. Why on earth did he offend an expert at Huang Xiaolong’s level?! </p>
			<p>Zhu Jian had it the worst. He wasn’t even half as strong as Jian Weifeng, but he caused trouble for Huang Xiaolong time and time again! He was even plotting to kill the man! Despite no one doing anything, Zhu Jian felt as though he would suffocate at any time!</p>
			<p>When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Mei Jie leaped into the air and he disappeared. Just as he was about to leave the city, a thick branch appeared in the air above to stop him.</p>
			<p>Mei Jie didn’t hesitate and the axe in his hand chopped at the branch that appeared.</p>
			<p>A loud blast reverberated through the air and a burst of light filled the space above the city.</p>
			<p>To everyone’s surprise, the third strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Lands, Mei Jie, who had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, failed to destroy the obstruction that stood in his way! He was sent flying backwards from the impact.</p>
			<p>Panic filled the hearts of those present. </p>
			<p>Mei Jie’s axe was a pseudo Universe Treasure! Even so, it failed to destroy the branch!</p>
			<p>Their gazes turned to the massive branch hovering in the air.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, and the others seemed to have thought of something and their eyes widened in shock. </p>
			<p>“Star Dragon Divine Tree!”  </p>
			<p>Gasps of shock filled the air.</p>
			<p>Countless roots and branches tore through the void at that instant and starlight fell upon the city. In an instant, day turned to night.</p>
			<p>“Quick! Everyone, work together and destroy the Star Dragon Grand Formation!” Elder Baixuan Tian yelled. “We cannot allow the roots to link up! Otherwise, none of us will be able to escape!”</p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian moved the moment she spoke. The white staff in her hand emitted a bone-chilling glow and it smashed into a corner of the void around her.𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang and Gui Chi moved in unison.</p>
			<p>An uncountable number of sword qi filled the skies and the river of time twisted under the power.</p>
			<p>At the same time, countless devils filled the skies. The world seemed to turn into hell on earth as the devils charged into the void.</p>
			<p>The experts in the hall circulated their grand cosmos energy and followed the actions of the trio. The combined might of more than a hundred experts who had broken through the 10 billion units barrier was a sight to behold! The world trembled around them as a terrifying amount of power smashed at the Star Dragon Grand Formation.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>Elder Baixuan Tian’s staff struck first, and Jian Wushuang’s attack came next. Gui Chi’s sea of devils came after and the Star Dragon Grand Formation trembled violently. Cracks started to form around the roots of the tree.</p>
			<p>Almost everyone in the hall had attacked! </p>
			<p>As everyone focused their attack on a single corner of the formation, it looked really possible that they would be able to destroy the point they were attacking!</p>
			<p>When they sent another round of attack at the corner, a massive ship appeared. It was millions of miles long, and it emitted a dense universe energy. It stopped all the attacks dead in their tracks.</p>
			<p>A slight tremble was all it suffered and considering the sheer size of the ship, it was as though nothing happened at all!</p>
			<p>“Universe… Universe Boat!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets and his beard trembled.</p>
			<p>The number one treasure in the thirteen universes! It actually appeared today!</p>
			<p>It was in the hands of the Blue Dragon Young Master, and not only did he possess the Universe Boat, he also had the second ranked treasure in the thirteen universes, the Star Dragon Divine Tree!</p>
			<p>The reactions of Elder Baixuan Tian, Gui Chi, and the rest were the same. </p>
			<p>As despair filled their hearts, Huang Xiaolong’s figure emerged from the Universe Boat. He held the Three Gods Halberd in his hand and the four Universe Origin Fires surrounded his body. Those standing against him felt a searing pain shooting through the dao souls as they looked at him.</p>
			<p>“Three… Three Gods Halberd!” </p>
			<p>“Universe Origin Fires!”</p>
			<p>It seemed as though there was no hope of winning any more.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed, he appeared before Mei Jie. Panicking, Mei Jie didn’t know how to react! It was at that moment, Huang Xiaolong’s halberd stabbed towards his chest. Even though he raised his axe to block the strike, the Three Gods Halberd tore through the axe like it was paper! Blowing a hole through Mei Jie’s chest, the tip of the halberd exited from his back!</p>
			<p>Mei Jie’s body froze in mid air as he stared at his wound in shock.</p>
			<p>The experts who were thinking of bombarding the Universe Boat with everything they had stopped.</p>
			<p>“Father!” Zhu Jian cried.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong pulled out the halberd mercilessly. His dao heart was in tatters and the Universe Origin Fires entered Mei Jie’s body the moment the halberd was retrieved. It burned his dao soul and Mei Jie fell to the ground in pain. His body was charred black and from afar, he looked like a piece of charcoal.</p>
			<p>Sharp intakes of breath could be heard all around.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3657: Opening of the Heavenly Peak</p>
			</title>
			<p>Mei Jie, who had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, failed to take a single strike from Huang Xiaolong! If that was the case, how many people in the hall could dream of standing against him?!</p>
			<p>With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong dragged Mei Jie’s sorry figure over to himself.</p>
			<p>A smile appeared on Mei Jie’s face all of a sudden. “If my son and I fail to return after the ceremony, Lord Zhu Chen will personally appear to deal with you. When Lord Green Ghost discovers the disappearance of Lord Gui Chi, he will also come over to the Jian Family to investigate the matter. Huang Xiaolong, no matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to stop them both!” </p>
			<p>“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong, even with the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires, you won’t be able to stand against the entire Unknown Lands!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand casually and his 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out of his body. A terrifying pressure descended on the lands and he sent Elder Baixuan Tian flying across the hall.</p>
			<p>“Going against the Unknown Lands?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “So what if I do?”</p>
			<p>The inner hall fell into silence.</p>
			<p>“Everyone, don’t panic!” Mei Jie roared. “We have more than ten thousand experts on our side! As long as we work together, he won’t be able to stop us all! Don’t tell me we’re afraid of a single man!” </p>
			<p>Mei Jie’s words sparked the fighting spirit of the various experts in the hall. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snorted lightly before rushing into the crowd. </p>
			<p>With the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, and the Three Gods Halberd, Huang Xiaolong was unstoppable!</p>
			<p>No one could break his defense, and his offensive was invincible!</p>
			<p>Not a single person could take a single hit from him!</p>
			<p>It was impossible for anyone to tear through his defenses either!</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong sent his grand cosmos energy into the Universe Boat, intricate universe laws descended all of a sudden and restricted the strength of his opponents!</p>
			<p>Even Jian Wushuang could only use eighty percent of his strength!</p>
			<p>There wasn’t a need to mention Gui Chi and the others.</p>
			<p>As one expert after another was sent flying, countless Gods of Creation fell to the ground.</p>
			<p>Wu Xin and Ye Ye revealed bitter smiles. They thought that Huang Xiaolong would be unable to challenge so many experts on his own, and that was why they brought so much backup over. From the looks of it, they were sorely mistaken…</p>
			<p>What the f*ck were they supposed to do when Huang Xiaolong could solo an entire army of God of Creation Realm cultivators alone?!</p>
			<p>The experts on the Jian Family’s side were beaten black and blue by the one man army.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang’s sword dao slashed at Huang Xiaolong again, but this time, he didn’t bother taking it head on. The Three Gods Halberd swept out, tearing his sword dao into pieces. Jian Wushuang was also sent tumbling through the air.</p>
			<p>That was the difference between someone who had barely broken through the 20 billion units mark in combat strength, and someone who had 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy! Huang Xiaolong’s actual combat strength far surpassed the amount of grand cosmos energy he had too, and no one stood a fighting chance!</p>
			<p>More than an hour later…</p>
			<p>Countless experts were lying defeated on the ground in the inner hall of the Jian Family Palace. Other than Wu Xin, Ye Ye, Yu Xiaohong, Tao Han’er, and the others, not a single person who stood against Huang Xiaolong remained standing.</p>
			<p>Zhu Jian was curled up in a ball in the corner of the hall and his body trembled violently.</p>
			<p>Glancing at Zhu Jian once, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with him.</p>
			<p>One day later…</p>
			<p>Everyone there submitted to Huang Xiaolong. Like how he controlled Wu Xin and Ye Ye, Huang Xiaolong branded their souls and wiped away the mark they originally had.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong revealed a look of joy when he saw the number of universe-level spiritual veins hovering in the air before him.</p>
			<p>Those were the universe-level spiritual veins he obtained from Jian Wushuang and the rest!</p>
			<p>Just those from Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie amounted to two hundred!</p>
			<p>Adding those from the other experts in the hall, he obtained a total of over six hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins!</p>
			<p>In the past, Huang Xiaolong cleaned out the experts of the Limitless Land and obtained more than a thousand universe-level spiritual veins. He had the feeling of limitless wealth then. Now, the feeling came back!</p>
			<p>Adding on those he obtained in the auction, he had more than eight hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sucked in a long breath.</p>
			<p>After turning them all into universe qi, how much would he be able to improve?!</p>
			<p>Could he reach the 26 billion units mark? </p>
			<p>It was even possible for him to accumulate 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong tossed all of them into his Sun Moon Furnace.</p>
			<p>After capturing Mei Jie, Huang Xiaolong knew that Zhu Chen would definitely realize that something was wrong. He knew he had to head over to catch Zhu Chen off guard before he became suspicious.</p>
			<p>“Lord, are you going to the Zhu Lan City? I can follow you there.” Gui Chi said. “The Heavenly Peak in the Zhu Lan City is about to open and I wish to attempt it.” </p>
			<p>“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly.</p>
			<p>The Heavenly Peak was one of the mysteries of the Unknown Lands. The Heavenly Peak was born from the universe and it was said that it had the ability to temper one’s dao heart and assist one in comprehending the mysteries of the universe.</p>
			<p>“Yes. In a month, the Heavenly Peak wil open!” Gui Chi replied respectfully.</p>
			<p>“In that case, we’ll head over to the Zhu Lan City tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong declared.</p>
			<p>They needed a month to arrive at the Zhu Lan City if they set out from the Unparalleled City.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi bowed, and Jian Wushuang cut in. “Lord, why don’t I go as well? I wish to take the chance to improve my sword dao on the Heavenly Peak.”</p>
			<p>“Do all of you want to go as well?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong.</p>
			<p>They nodded awkwardly. </p>
			<p>Naturally, they didn’t wish to miss that opportunity!</p>
			<p>“Alright. We shall all head over together.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.𝐟𝗿𝗲𝗲𝘄𝗲𝐛𝐧𝐨𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝗰𝐨𝐦</p>
			<p>The very next day, Huang Xiaolong’s party set off for the Zhu Lan City.</p>
			<p>As Tao Han’er pestered him to bring her along, he laughed helplessly before agreeing.</p>
			<p>As for the other Gods of Creation who didn’t wish to ascend the Heavenly Peak, Huang Xiaolong allowed them to do whatever they wished. </p>
			<p>“Get someone to investigate Zhu Chen’s whereabouts.” Huang Xiaolong turned to Jian Wushuang and said.</p>
			<p>They quickly received a report.</p>
			<p>“Zhu Chen isn’t in the city?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.</p>
			<p>“Yes. Zhu Chen went to the Fengdu City in the Green Ghost Lands and will only be back after some time.” Jian Wushuang replied.</p>
			<p>“Green Ghost Lands?” Gui Chi was slightly taken aback. The Green Ghost Lands was controlled by Lord Green Ghost, and the Fengdu City was their capital city!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3658: Should We Go Together?</p>
			</title>
			<p>“What did Zhu Chen go there for?” Huang Xiaolong asked Jian Wushuang.</p>
			<p>“This… I’m not too sure. Why don’t I get them to make a detailed investigation?” Jian Wushuang replied.</p>
			<p>Grunting slightly, Huang Xiaolong thought of the various possibilities. There was no way Zhu Chen would go over to the Fengdu City for fun.</p>
			<p>“Lord, why don’t we head over to the Fengdu City after ascending the Heavenly Peak?” Tao Han’er asked.</p>
			<p>“Fengdu City? Why do you want to go to Fengdu City?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>“Hehe, the city is the number one city in the Green Ghost Lands. It’s also one of the five greatest cities in our Unknown Lands! I heard that everyone there is a ghost spirit… I wish to take a look!” Tao Han’er giggled.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Those who remain in the Fengdu City for a long time are indeed ghost spirits. The yin qi in the city is extremely strong. Those who are weaker wouldn’t dare to stay there for long. You’re just a Second Resurrection Dao Venerable… You can’t stay for more than two seconds in the city…” </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang and the others burst out laughing.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er pouted, “Hmph! You’re bullying me again! In the future, I’ll continue to cultivate and enter the Universe God Realm! You can’t laugh at me anymore when that happens!”  </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong tried to contain his laughter and he replied, “Wow, that’s quite a goal…” </p>
			<p>Another round of laughter ensued.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er glared at him and snapped, “Why can’t I have a target when you have one of you own?” </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang whispered at the side, “Han’er, do not speak to the Lord so disrespectfully!” </p>
			<p>Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong dismissed Jian Wushuang’s worries. “Don’t worry about it.” </p>
			<p>He then turned to Tao Han’er and smiled, “Alright, we’ll see who enters the Universe God Realm first!” </p>
			<p>“That’s unfair! You already have more than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy! I haven’t even formed my first strand! You’ll definitely be faster than me!” Tao Han’er complained softly.</p>
			<p>Wu Xin and the others roared with laughter when they heard what she said.</p>
			<p>She was the little happy pill that entertained everyone along the way. Because of her, their journey became much more enjoyable.</p>
			<p>Almost a month later, they arrived.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat and looked at the majestic city standing before him. The Zhu Lan City seemed boundless, and the mountain ranges contained within were like pillars that propped up the heavens! Huang Xiaolong couldn’t even see the peak of it!”</p>
			<p>Even with three dao souls operating at full power, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the tallest peak!</p>
			<p>That was what the Heavenly Peak was…</p>
			<p>It was one of the greatest wonders of the Unknown Lands.</p>
			<p>Ordinarily, the Heavenly Peak would be shrouded in clouds and the restrictions around it would be frighteningly strong. The clouds would scatter once every few eras. Anyone could take the chance to ascend the Heavenly Peak. </p>
			<p>When the clouds returned and the restrictions came back, not even experts at the level of the five overlords had the ability to force their way up. The Heavenly Peak seemed to contain the power of the universe origin. It was the power that stopped anyone from trying to force their way up, and it was the power that scattered together with the clouds.</p>
			<p>“Lord, the clouds around the peak have scattered.” Tao Han’er pointed in the distance and cheered.</p>
			<p>Indeed. The clouds seemed to have been torn apart by some unnatural power as the peak was revealed to the world.𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝒐𝙫𝙚𝓵.𝓬𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>“Lord Huang, the Heavenly Peak is about to be fully open…” Yu Xiaohong reminded him from the side.</p>
			<p>Nodding, Huang Xiaolong said, “We’ll head over right now.” </p>
			<p>Just as Huang Xiaolong and his group of experts were about to head over to the city, a group of cultivators appeared behind them.</p>
			<p>“Are you also here to climb the Heavenly Peak?” One of the middle aged men in the group called out to them. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the newcomers and discovered that they were Dao Venerables who had comprehended twelve to thirteen elements to the grand perfection level. The person who spoke to them was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level.</p>
			<p>“Yeah!” Huang Xiaolong replied casually.</p>
			<p>“I am Chen Bi of the Feihong Celestial Empire. I am the young master of the Chen Family, and I wonder where fellow cultivator came from!” The middle aged man smiled.</p>
			<p>“Feihong Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang smiled, “The old ancestor of their celestial empire is a God of Creation at the small completion stage.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong understood the hidden meaning behind Jian Wushuang’s words immediately.</p>
			<p>In that case, the Chen Family was nothing more than a tiny blip in the Zhu Lan Lands.</p>
			<p>If the old ancestor of their celestial empire was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, the old ancestor of the Chen Family couldn’t be much stronger.</p>
			<p>When Chen Bi overheard Jian Wushuang’s introduction of their celestial empire, a proud smile appeared on his face. “The old ancestor of my Chen Family is also a God of Creation at the small completion stage, comparable to the old ancestor of the celestial empire!” A confident smile appeared on his face and he glanced at Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er from the corner of his eye.</p>
			<p>His actions didn’t escape Huang Xiaolong’s observations and a chuckle rang in his ear. “Oh! Excuse us! Your old ancestor is actually a God of Creation at the small completion stage!” </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er and the rest nearly burst out laughing.</p>
			<p>Did the man who soloed nearly ten thousand Gods of Creation back at the Jian Family, including the terrifying Jian Wushuang whose combat strength broke through the 20 billion units mark say ‘excuse me’ to the grandson of a God of Creation at the small completion stage?!</p>
			<p>Chen Bi didn’t understand the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words and he continued haughtily, “I wonder which powerful expert stands behind your family?” </p>
			<p>Ordinarily, those who had the ability to come to the Heavenly Peak were disciples of great powers. Those powers naturally had God of Creation Realm experts at the helm.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong laughed, “My father is called Huang Long and you can call me Huang Xiaolong.” </p>
			<p>“Huang Long?” A look of confusion appeared on Chen Bi’s face. He tried to rack his brains and he couldn’t think of anyone with that name in the God of Creation Realm.</p>
			<p>“Young Master, he might not even be a God of Creation. From the looks of it, his Huang Family might be some third-rate family from some random continent…” One of the young men beside Chen Bi whispered into his ear.</p>
			<p>There were always exceptions to those who came to climb the Heavenly Peak.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi chuckled after hearing what his clansman said. “As it turns out, Brother Huang is from the great Huang Family! Why don’t we ascend the peak together?” </p>
			<p>Wu Xin, Ye Ye, Yu Xiaohong, Jian Wushuang, and the others were trying their best to hold in their laughter when they caught a stare from Huang Xiaolong. They swallowed their response to Chen Bi and Huang Xiaolong turned to reply, “Sure!” </p>
			<p>Chen Bi’s group ended up joining Huang Xiaolong’s squad of Gods of Creation as they headed towards the Zhu Lan City.</p>
			<p>“How can I address the two beauties?” Chen Bi asked Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er all of a sudden. </p>
			<p>A frown formed on Yu Xiaohong’s face. After all, she had the ability to wipe out his entire family with a flick of her fingers. She was too lazy to respond to a junior at his level.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er, on the other hand, was only at the Dao Venerable Realm. She replied softly, “I am Tao Han’er…”</p>
			<p>“Oh! Young Lady Tao Han’er. I didn’t think that you would try to ascend the Heavenly Peak at the Second Resurrection Dao Venerable Realm. Please follow behind me later. I’ll protect you.” Chen Bi laughed.</p>
			<p>“My granddaughter doesn’t need your protection…” Jian Wushuang growled at the side.</p>
			<p>Stunned, Chen Bi replied to Jian Wushuang politely. “Sorry, I didn’t think that you were her grandfather! My apologies!” </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang didn’t bother looking his way and neither did he give a response.</p>
			<p>Stuck in an awkward situation, Chen Bi turned to Huang Xiaolong who seemed the friendliest of the bunch and asked, “Brother Huang, how many times have you tried to ascend the Heavenly Peak?”</p>
			<p>“This is my first time.” </p>
			<p>Nodding slightly, Chen Bi explained, “This is my third time ascending the Heavenly Peak! The process places emphasis on your dao heart and your comprehension of the grand dao laws. When I came for the first time, I only managed to reach the 30th platform. On my second try, I managed to reach the 80th platform!” </p>
			<p>One of the disciples of the Chen Family interrupted, “Our young master will reach the 100th platform this time and break through to the God of Creation Realm!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3659: What’s the Problem?</p>
			</title>
			<p>The disciples spoke pretty loudly and confidently, attracting the attention of disciples nearby.</p>
			<p>“Chen Bi! What is the young master of the Chen Family doing here! Aren’t you the most talented one? You’re one of the four geniuses of our Feihong Celestial Empire! Many people said that he will definitely be able to break through to the God of Creation Realm this time!” One of the groups in the distance recognized Chen Bi and he cried.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi smiled humbly at Huang Xiaolong, “That’s just something they made up themselves. I’m not as talented as they say!” </p>
			<p>However, the grin on his face revealed his true feelings.</p>
			<p>Wu Xin and Ye Ye exchanged a glance and smiled. If not for Huang Xiaolong stopping them, they would have sent the arrogant brat to the afterlife.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Then I shall congratulate you in advance on your breakthrough then!” </p>
			<p>Chen Bi didn’t reject it. “Many thanks, Brother Huang!” </p>
			<p>As they continued on their way, Huang Xiaolong asked casually, “Didn’t your ancestor come to ascend the mountain?” </p>
			<p>“We ran into the old ancestor of the Du Family of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. He decided to travel with ancestor Du Chengjiang and he should be coming soon.” Chen Bi explained. </p>
			<p>“Old ancestor of the Du Family?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Yu Xiaohong. Who better to answer his question than the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire?</p>
			<p>“Du Chengjiang is a God of Creation at the large completion stage. He has around 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” She replied.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi looked at Yu Xiaohong and he gasped lightly. “I didn’t expect young lady to know about Lord Du Chengjiang! That’s right. Lord Du is a God of Creation at the large completion stage. Even in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, he’s an amazing figure.” </p>
			<p>“We have a great relationship with Lord Du!” Chen Bi continued to exaggerate, afraid that Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er weren't paying attention. “Lord Du often visits my Chen Family and he even gave me pointers when cultivating!” </p>
			<p>It was a glorious thing to be able to receive pointers from a God of Creation at the large completion stage!</p>
			<p>Not everyone could get a chance to do so.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “When the time comes, please do the introductions. I would like to meet this Lord Du Chengjiang you’re talking about.” </p>
			<p>“Naturally.” Chen Bi smiled. “I can make several introductions when the time comes, including the two ladies!” He looked at Tao Han’er and Yu Xiaohong.</p>
			<p>Very quickly, they arrived in the city.</p>
			<p>They saw many people heading towards the Heavenly Peak, and one of the disciples beside Chen Bi said all of a sudden, “Young Master, that’s Lord Zhu Ding!” </p>
			<p>Chen Bi looked over only to see the inner disciple of the Zhu Family walking towards them. A grin formed on his face and he rushed over. He greeted them respectfully, “Chen Bi greets Lord Zhu Ding and Lord Zhu Yuan!” </p>
			<p>The two of them were the inner disciples of the Zhu Family, but even though they were mere inner disciples, their status was much higher than Chen Bi! </p>
			<p>He only managed to get acquainted with them during one of the banquets held by some superpower in the region.</p>
			<p>“Oh? Are you the young master of the Chen Family from the Feihong Celestial Empire?” Zhu Ding crossed his hands across his chest and sneered. </p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan remained expressionless as he ignored Chen Bi entirely.</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes! That’s me! I didn’t expect Lord Zhu Ding to remember me!” He felt extremely honored as excitement bubbled in his heart.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan casually swept their gaze across Huang Xiaolong’s group. Their eyes lit up when they saw Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er.</p>
			<p>“Are these two young ladies disciples of your Chen Family too?” Zhu Ding smiled suddenly.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi hesitated slightly, but he quickly replied, “No. They are my friends. This young lady is called Tao Han’er!” </p>
			<p>The disciples of the Zhu Family didn’t connect her name to the princess of the Jian Family, and Zhu Ding nodded. “Young Lady Tao Han’er.”</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er ignored the disciples of the Zhu Family completely. “Lord Huang, shall we go?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded and he turned to leave. Yu Xiaohong, Jian Wushuang, and the others followed closely behind. </p>
			<p>The expressions on Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan sank instantly.</p>
			<p>The moment they did, Chen Bi jumped in fright. He quickly explained, “They come from a third-rate family and they don’t know who Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan are! Please forgive them! I will lecture them the moment I get back!” </p>
			<p>Their expression finally started to let up after hearing what Chen Bi said.</p>
			<p>“Third-rate family?” Zhu Yuan looked at their leaving figures and a sinister expression formed on his face.</p>
			<p>If Huang Xiaolong came from some super power, he might be afraid to do anything to them. However, things were different when they had no backing.</p>
			<p>“I’ll give you a chance. Host a banquet for the two of us in the Maple Moon Pavilion tonight. Bring the two ladies with you.”  </p>
			<p>Chen Bi was stunned. However, happiness soon filled his heart. Even so, he seemed to have recalled something and he stuttered, “The Heavenly Peak is about to open soon. Lords, why don’t I host the two of you after it ends?” </p>
			<p>Ascending the peak the moment it opened was the ideal choice. After all, the clouds would only scatter for a month. One month later, everything would come to an end. No one wished to miss the chance to improve themselves!</p>
			<p>The clouds in the air were about to scatter and Chen Bi didn’t want to miss the chance to ascend!</p>
			<p>“What’s the problem? Are you unwilling to do so?” Zhu Ding growled.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi explained hurriedly, “No! Of course not! However, that young man isn’t from my Chen Family! Han’er seems to be following him. He might not agree…” </p>
			<p>“Hmph. Tell him that he won’t get the chance to attempt the climb if he refuses! I’ll kick him off the mountain myself! Do you know what to do now?!” Zhu Ding snorted.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi nodded his head hastily, “Yes, yes… I understand.”𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>“Go! Remember, Maple Moon Pavilion! Bring both the ladies with you!” Zhu Yuan growled at the side.</p>
			<p>The Maple Moon Pavilion was the largest establishment in the Zhu Lan City. Chen Bi bowed towards them before bringing the disciples of his Chen Family to chase after Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>When he finally caught up, he hesitated slightly before speaking to Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, just a moment ago, Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan told me to arrange a banquet for them at the Maple Moon Pavilion. He said that he wants Brother Huang to bring the two ladies with you…”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3660: Never Heard of You</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s entire party stopped walking all of a sudden and they turned to stare at Chen Bi.</p>
			<p>The look in their eyes caused his hair to stand on end.</p>
			<p>“Banquet in the Maple Moon Pavilion? Bring the two ladies with me?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually.</p>
			<p>“That’s right! It’s an order from Lord Zhu Ding and Lord Zhu Yuan!” Chen Bi muttered.</p>
			<p>One of the disciples beside Chen Bi sneered all of a sudden, “You better know what’s good for you! If you offend the two lords, they’ll kick you off the mountain when you try to ascend tomorrow!” </p>
			<p>“Oh? Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s tone turned a lot frostier.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi cackled eerily and he opened his mouth slightly. The body of the disciple who just spoke dried up as his blood essence, dao soul, and all the energy contained within was sucked out. He turned into a dry corpse that scattered into dust.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi and the rest of the disciples were shocked by the sudden change in situation. They stared at Gui Chi in fright! The disciple might not have comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level, but he was still a respectable Dao Venerable who had comprehended twelve elements! Even so, he was killed in the blink of an eye!</p>
			<p>None of them had seen anything like that happen before! </p>
			<p>“You!” Chen Bi roared.</p>
			<p>“Go tell the two clowns to scram. If they annoy me, I wouldn’t mind going to the Zhu Family myself to tear off their heads before using it as a football.” Huang Xiaolong whispered into Chen Bi’s ear.</p>
			<p>Staring at him with his jaws agape, Chen Bi didn’t know how to react.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong brought everyone towards the foot of the mountain.</p>
			<p>“Lord, just kill the two brats from the Zhu Family. After that, we’ll go behead that brat, Zhu Ji! We’ll use all their heads as footballs!” Gui Chi revealed a sinister smile and said.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji was the patriarch of the Zhu Family, and he was the celestial emperor of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire.</p>
			<p>“The Heavenly Peak is about to open. We’ll talk about it later.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>When their exchange went down, the disciples of the Chen Family were still stuck in their place. They didn’t dare to move until Huang Xiaolong’s entire group disappeared into the distance.</p>
			<p>“Young Master, that brat is too arrogant! We’ll report this to Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan!” Another disciple beside Chen Bi growled. “We’ll see how the two lords take care of them!” </p>
			<p>“That’s right! How dare they kill the disciples of our Chen Family?” </p>
			<p>The other disciples of the Chen Family yelled in unison.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi looked at the disciple beside him and he said, “The two lords are still in the area. Go make the report to them right now. Tell them that the brat refused to listen to them and killed the disciples of our Chen Family!” </p>
			<p>The disciple nodded and ran off.</p>
			<p>“Oh right, tell Lord Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan everything the kid said! Tell them word for word!” Chen Bi added as the disciple was running away.</p>
			<p>Word for word?</p>
			<p>The disciple paused for a second and he recalled how Huang Xiaolong said that he would head over to the Zhu Family personally.</p>
			<p>“Yes, young master! Please rest assured that I’ll make the report exactly how he said it!” </p>
			<p>“Let’s go look for the old ancestor and Lord Du Chengjiang!” Chen Bi said to the rest after the disciple had left. </p>
			<p>Very quickly, they managed to contact their old ancestor, Chen Bi*</p>
			<p>“Lord Ancestor and Lord Du Chengjiang have already arrived at the foot of the mountain.” Chen Bi smiled. “Ancestor Chen Bi said that they are currently together with Lord Xu Fei.” </p>
			<p>“Lord Xu Fei of the Xu Family?” The disciples of the Chen Family revealed excited looks too.</p>
			<p>Lord Xu Fei was a God of Creation at the peak of the large completion stage. He was also from the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, and he had close to 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was pretty famous in the territory. </p>
			<p>“It’s great that Lord Xu Fei is there!” The disciples of the Chen Family jumped in joy.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi chuckled, “Let’s hurry up then…”</p>
			<p>“Yes, young master!” </p>
			<p>When they headed to meet their ancestor, the disciple he sent out earlier found Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan. He told them exactly what Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>“Did that kid actually say that?!” Zhu Ding growled. </p>
			<p>“You better not be lying to us…” Zhu Yuan glared at the disciple and his expression darkened.</p>
			<p>Falling to his knees, the disciple swore to the heavens. “On my life, I swear that I didn’t change a word he said! If I’m lying to Lords Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding, my dao soul will scatter and I’ll die a horrible death! When you find the kid, you’ll know if that was what he said!” </p>
			<p>“Hmm… Yeah, you wouldn’t dare to lie to us.” Zhu Ding looked at Zhu Yuan. “He dares to ignore the two of us! Let’s go to the foot of the mountain now and look for him!” </p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan nodded. “Hey, he might have some sort of backing if he dares to speak to us like this. Let’s look for Lord Zhu Chenlong before doing anything else.” </p>
			<p>Zhu Chenlong was a doyen of the Zhu Family and he was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. The two of them had been giving him lots of gifts and they could be considered acquainted with him.</p>
			<p>“Alright! Let’s look for Lord Zhu Chenlong!” </p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>Before long, Chen Bi and the other disciples of the Chen Family arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p>
			<p>The clouds around the top were mostly scattered, but it should take a little more time for them to completely disappear.</p>
			<p>They located their old ancestor and the ancestors of the Du and Xu family not too far away.</p>
			<p>Hurrying over, the disciples greeted the old ancestors respectfully.</p>
			<p>Ancestor Chen Bi allowed them to get up and he asked, “Didn’t you say that you had something to report to me? What’s so urgent?”  </p>
			<p>“Lord Ancestor, Chen Hongxin was killed by someone!” Chen Bi revealed a sorrowful expression and continued, “He was killed just a moment ago!” </p>
			<p>“Oh?” Ancestor Chen Bi frowned. He knew who Chen Hongxin was. He was a core disciple of the Chen Family and his talent was extremely good! After all, those who were chosen to climb the Heavenly Peak were true geniuses of their factions.</p>
			<p>Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei frowned.</p>
			<p>“Do you know who the other party was?” Ancestor Chen Bi asked.</p>
			<p>“He said that his father is called Huang Long and his name is Huang Xiaolong!” Chen Bi replied.𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p>“Huang Long? Huang Xiaolong?” A confused expression appeared on Ancestor Chen Bi’s face. He turned to look at the other two Gods of Creation and he asked, “Fellow cultivators, have you heard of them?” </p>
			<p>Du Chenjiang and Xu Fei didn’t attend the Jian Family’s ceremony and didn’t know anything. They shook their heads slowly.</p>
			<p>“I never heard of any Huang Family in our Zhu Lan Lands.” Xu Fei sighed. “All the other regions I’ve been to didn’t contain a Huang Family…” </p>
			<p>“I never heard of anyone by the name of Huang Long or Huang Xiaolong either.” </p>
			<p>Note: Chen Bi and Lord Ancestor Chen Bi, the two ‘Bi’ have different intonation and meaning.</p>

			</title>
			<p>“Where is that Huang Xiaolong now?” Ancestor Chen Bi asked.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi could tell that his ancestor was finally going to take action and he sniggered in his heart. “That brat came with a few of his subordinates to climb the Heavenly Peak. They should have arrived.”</p>
			<p>“Arrived?” Ancestor Chen Bi turned to look at the crowd around him.</p>
			<p>The Heavenly Peak was massive and it spanned hundreds of million of miles. It was indeed quite impossible to look for several people in the crowd.</p>
			<p>As the clouds were still dissipating, the restrictions around the Heavenly Peak hadn’t loosened yet. There were some experts who tried to use their dao souls to probe around and they were attacked by the restrictions! Their dao souls were seriously injured, and they lost their minds.</p>
			<p>Not even half-step Universe Gods dared to use their dao souls before the restrictions disappeared.</p>
			<p>“The Heavenly Peak will close in a month. We’ll look for them after this is over.” Du Chengjiang said.</p>
			<p>Ancestor Chen Bi nodded in agreement.</p>
			<p>“Lord Ancestor, why don’t we go look around for him now?” Chen Bi said all of a sudden.  </p>
			<p>“Alright.” Ancestor Chen Bi muttered. “If you find him, report back to me immediately.” </p>
			<p>The disciples of the Chen Family started their search. They went to look for traces of Huang Xiaolong and all those they saw around him.</p>
			<p>Despite their best efforts, they failed to catch a glimpse of them.</p>
			<p>Seeing as the clouds were about to disappear, Chen Bi started to panic. </p>
			<p>The disciples of the Zhu Family were doing the same thing as them! Despite the number of Zhu Family disciples in the crowd, they failed to find Huang Xiaolong all the same.</p>
			<p>Soon, the shadow of the mountain peak appeared in the air. </p>
			<p>Massive platforms started to appear around the Heavenly Peak.</p>
			<p>“Ascend!” One of the experts yelled excitedly.</p>
			<p>Countless experts made their move as they rushed towards the platforms in the air.</p>
			<p>“Young Master, it’s time to climb the mountain!” One of the disciples around Chen Bi yelled. “We’ll look for them after the Heavenly Peak closes! Once it does, that brat won’t be able to escape!”</p>
			<p>“He can count himself lucky… I’ll let him live for one more month!” Chen Bi snoted before turning towards the mountain.</p>
			<p>At that moment, Gui Chi was staring at the peak of the mountain with a heated gaze.</p>
			<p>He wanted to use the chance to transform the two great worlds in his body! When that happened, his combat strength would also break through the 20 billion units mark!</p>
			<p>As for Jian Wushuang, he felt the sword qi in his body heating up slightly.</p>
			<p>“Climb the mountain at your own pace. There’s no need to worry about me.” Huang Xiaolong noticed the looks in their eyes and he said.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Wu Xin, and Ye Ye glanced at each other before bowing respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Lord, we’ll start our ascension now.” Jian Wushuang said.</p>
			<p>“Go ahead.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>The four of them moved at once as they arrived on the first platform. They didn’t stop as the pressure on the first platform failed to obstruct them. They immediately moved on to the second platform.</p>
			<p>“Let’s head up too…” Huang Xiaolong laughed as he looked at Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er. </p>
			<p>Tao Han’er giggled, “I want to follow you up there!” </p>
			<p>“Me too!” Yu Xiaohong revealed an enchanting smile.</p>
			<p>With a helpless shake of his head, Huang Xiaolong explained, “I’m going to try to reach the peak of the mountain! You won’t be able to follow me up there.” </p>
			<p>The stronger they were, the higher they could climb. That was a fact. There was no way the two of them could follow him, considering the difference in their strength.</p>
			<p>“Regardless, we wish to start the climb with you!” Tao Han’er pouted.</p>
			<p>“Alright, alright.” Huang Xiaolong smiled before soaring up to the first platform.</p>
			<p>The platforms were filled with intricate runes and Huang Xiaolong found them to be slightly similar to the runes in the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>As he stepped onto the first platform, he felt a mysterious energy entering his body. It was like a warm current that extended to every corner of his being. His three great dao souls felt a sense of enlightenment.</p>
			<p>Refining the energy from the first platform in the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong took another step and arrived on the second platform.</p>
			<p>Yu Xiaohong appeared beside him the moment he did, but Tao Han’er wasn’t so capable. She remained motionless on the first platform.</p>
			<p>As a Second Resurrection Dao Venerable, she needed one day’s time to digest the energy from the first platform!</p>
			<p>One could only advance after refining the energy on the platform they were on. If they tried to force their way up, they would receive a backlash from the Heavenly Peak.</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er could only watch as Huang Xiaolong and Yu Xiaohong got further and further away!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued up the platforms at a leisurely pace.</p>
			<p>Initially, Yu Xiaohong was able to keep up with him. However, she started falling behind soon enough. </p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to catch up to Wu Xin and Ye Ye.</p>
			<p>Next came Gui Chi and finally, he overtook Jian Wushuang.</p>
			<p>All of them looked at Huang Xiaolong with admiration in their eyes. Wu Xin turned to Ye Ye and asked, “Do you think His Highness will be able to reach the peak?” </p>
			<p>“It’s hard to say. Lord Ferocious Devil and Lord Green Ghost tried to do so, but neither one of them managed to do it. Lord Ferocious Devil once said that only Universe Gods would be able to arrive at the peak.</p>
			<p>The five overlords tried to ascend the Heavenly Peak more than once in the past. However, not even the strongest of them all, the Ferocious Devil, could reach the top.𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦𝑤𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong stood at the halfway point, his speed started to slow down. He looked down towards the foot of the mountain and tried to look at all the experts below him. Every single platform contained its own world and one couldn’t see too far away. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see further than ten platforms down.</p>
			<p>“Is it really true that only Universe Gods can reach the top?” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.</p>
			<p>He knew what the Ferocious Devil said. However, he wanted to challenge the fact and arrive at the peak of the mountain without reaching the Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>After taking several breaths, Huang Xiaolong continued to ascend.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3662: Conclusion</p>
			</title>
			<p>The deadline of a month quickly arrived. There was only a single hour left till the Heavenly Peak closed, and a disturbance occurred on the one-hundredth step!</p>
			<p>“Someone is breaking through to the God of Creation Realm!” Everyone looked at the platform in disbelief!</p>
			<p>“It’s Young Master Chen Bi from the Feihong Celestial Empire! This is his third time ascending the mountain and he finally broke through!” Someone yelled.</p>
			<p>The voice quickly traveled across the lands and Ancestor Chen Bi caught wind of the news.</p>
			<p>Joy filled Ancestor Chen Bi’s heart and he roared with laughter, “Nice! My Chen Family will finally have its second God of Creation!” </p>
			<p>There was a legend in the Unknown Lands. When a second God of Creation appears in the family, they will definitely be able to give birth to the third and fourth! Their family would only grow stronger and stronger!</p>
			<p>The old ancestors around Ancestor Chen Bi congratulated him.</p>
			<p>“Brother Chen, congratulations! Your Chen Family needs to hold a celebration after you return!” 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p>“Of course!”  </p>
			<p>The smile on Ancestor Chen Bi’s face grew wider and wider.</p>
			<p>At that moment, Chen Bi felt the grand cosmos energy in his body rolling about and excitement bubbled in his heart. He finally broke through!</p>
			<p>He could finally be ranked among the strongest cultivators in the Unknown Lands!</p>
			<p>The difference between a Dao Venerable at the peak level and a God of Creation might be small, but the difference in status was huge! One would only be revered after breaking through to the God of Creation Realm!</p>
			<p>Another hour passed in the blink of an eye and the Heavenly Peak ascension ended.</p>
			<p>A mysterious power that seemed to come from the universe origin sent them back to the foot of the mountain. Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, and even Huang Xiaolong were sent back to the bottom.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang and the others quickly gathered around Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A somber expression hung on Gui Chi’s face. It seemed as though his attempt to breakthrough had failed.</p>
			<p>In contrast, the subtle smile that hung on Jian Wushuang’s face showed that he gained quite a lot during his trip.</p>
			<p>“Your Highness, how is it?” Yu Xiaohong hesitated for a moment before asking.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang and the rest were equally as curious.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “Reaching the peak is harder than I thought!” </p>
			<p>Before he tried, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could do what the Ferocious Devil couldn’t! However, one month proved to be too short! He couldn’t even see the peak, much less reach it! He needed to ascend at least ten more steps before arriving at the top!</p>
			<p>There was a rumor going around the Unknown Lands that even though the Ferocious Devil failed to reach the top, he caught a glance of the peak!</p>
			<p>That alone told Huang Xiaolong that he was still a distance away from the Ferocious Devil.</p>
			<p>It didn’t seem too bad if they thought about it logically. The Ferocious Devil was a supreme overlord who existed since eons ago! It made sense for him to be much stronger than Huang Xiaolong who hadn’t been cultivating for a fraction of the time he had!</p>
			<p>Regardless of what happened, Huang Xiaolong had absolute confidence that he would be able to climb to the peak the next time the Heavenly Peak opened! </p>
			<p>He wanted to use the chance to break through to the Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>“Where’s Han’er?” Huang Xiaolong asked Jian Wushuang all of a sudden.</p>
			<p>All of them finally realized that Tao Han’er wasn’t with them, and they looked at each other in confusion.</p>
			<p>Their expressions sank when they noticed a group of disciples of the Zhu Family harassing her in the distance.</p>
			<p>They weren’t anyone else, but Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan!</p>
			<p>Tao Han’er glared at them and she growmed, “What do you want?!” </p>
			<p>Zhu Ding laughed sinisterly, “What do we want? Young Lady Han’er, you will soon find out. Hehe…” </p>
			<p>Coincidentally, Zhu Yuan caught sight of Huang Xiaolong and the others from the corner of his eye and he nudged Zhu Ding, “That brat and his slaves are here. I’ll call for Lord Zhu Chenlong right now!” </p>
			<p>Zhu Ding turned around and a sneer formed on his face. Zhu Yuan crushed the talisman in his hand to notify their doyen.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong and gang were walking towards Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding, the disciples of the Chen Family noticed them as well. They quickly reported the discovery to Chen Bi and Ancestor Chen Bi.</p>
			<p>At that moment, Ancestor Chen Bi was with Ancestor Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei.</p>
			<p>They were in high spirits as Chen Bi had broken through to the God of Creation Realm!</p>
			<p>“Oh? You discovered the kid?” Chen Bi smiled when he heard the news.</p>
			<p>“Yes! They’re right there! Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan are there too!” The disciples of the Chen Family who made the report explained.</p>
			<p>A light flashed in Chen Bi’s eyes. “Lords Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding are there too? Great!” </p>
			<p>“Yes.” </p>
			<p>“Zhu Ding? Zhu Yuan?” Ancestor Chen Bi raised an eyebrow in surprise. </p>
			<p>Chen Bi explained, ‘The two of them are inner disciples of the Zhu Family. I met them previously and we’re pretty well acquainted. Lord Ancestor, Lord Du, Lord Xu, let's go! I’ll introduce them to you!” </p>
			<p>The three of them nodded eventually.</p>
			<p>As such, the Chen Family’s group started to make their way over.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for Ancestor Chen Bi, Du Chengjiang, and Xu Fei to notice the group. As Huang Xiaolong’s party was walking in their direction, they recognized Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong instantly.</p>
			<p>The faces of the three ancestors changed drastically. </p>
			<p>Even though Ancestor Chen Bi was a God of Creation at the small completion stage and was the old ancestor of a small family, he could recognize the heavy weights of the Unknown Lands!</p>
			<p>His eyes seemed to pop out of their sockets.</p>
			<p>“Yu… Yu… Yu…” Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei felt their souls leaving their bodies. </p>
			<p>Chen Bi noticed the flustered expressions of the trio and he couldn’t help but ask, “Lord Ancestors, this…” </p>
			<p>He heard a miserable cry in the distance and he couldn’t help but turn to look. He saw the inner disciples of the Zhu Family turn to meat paste with a single slap from Gui Chi! Not even their dao souls managed to escape!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3663: Freak</p>
			</title>
			<p>Chen Bi stood rooted to the spot and he stared in disbelief.</p>
			<p>He wasn’t surprised by Gui Chi’s strength! Instead, he couldn’t believe that Gui Chi would kill inner disciples of the Zhu Family! That was the first time he had seen anyone ballsy enough to kill a Zhu Family disciple in the Zhu Lan Lands!</p>
			<p>Moreover, they were in the Zhu Lan City!</p>
			<p>The three ancestors jumped in fright when they saw what Gui Chi did. They were paralyzed with fear as they had heard of Gui Chi’s reputation before!</p>
			<p>Before Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion barrier, Gui Chi’s fame could be said to be even bigger than his! One reason was because Gui Chi was Lord Green Ghost’s strongest general. The second was because of his bloodthirst! The number of experts who died in his hands were uncountable! There were even sayings that if Gui Chi claimed to be the second greatest mass-murderer in the Unknown Lands, no one would dare to claim to be first!</p>
			<p>“That ghost-like b*stard slave of the brat is crazy! How dare he kill an inner disciple of the Zhu Family here?!” One of the Chen Family disciples beside Chen Bi gasped in shock.</p>
			<p>HIs words caused the three ancestors’ legs to go completely numb. If they were nearly paralyzed with shock previously, they were truly frozen in fear now.</p>
			<p>Did the disciple of the Chen Family just call Gui Chi a ‘ghost-like b*stard’?!</p>
			<p>Everyone in the Unknown Lands knew that Gui Chi hated people discussing his looks! </p>
			<p>Their brains turned quickly. Wait a second. Wasn’t Gui Chi Lord Green ghost’s aide? Why was he following someone else now?</p>
			<p>They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong as extreme fear bloomed in their hearts.</p>
			<p>Was that the person Chen Bi was talking about?!</p>
			<p>They might not have seen Huang Xiaolong before, but their intuition told them they were looking right at him. Not just Gui Chi… Jian Wushuang, Yu Xiaohong, the Limitless Master, and the King of the Ocean Races were following by his side!</p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan stared at Zhu Ding’s corpse in utter disbelief. Rage filled his heart and his face twisted in anger, “You… you’re dead!”</p>
			<p>Before Gui Chi could kill the brat, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop him.</p>
			<p>“We’re dead?” Huang Xiaolong laughed.</p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan could hear the mockery in Huang Xiaolong’s voice and his expression sank. Killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, the disciple beside Zhu Yuan whispered into his ear. “Brother Zhu Yuan, Lord Zhu Chenlong is here.” </p>
			<p>Turning to the side, he saw a group of experts of the Zhu Family flying towards them. The person leading them was precisely Zhu Chenlong!</p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan and the disciples of the Zhu Family hastily welcomed them.</p>
			<p>“We greet Lord Zhu Chenlong!” </p>
			<p>“Where’s Zhu Ding?” Zhu Chenlong said while nodding his head. </p>
			<p>“Lord Zhu Chenlong, Zhu Ding was killed by those *ssholes! Lord Zhu Chenlong, please seek justice on his behalf!” Zhu Yuan cried in anger.</p>
			<p>“What?! Zhu Ding was killed?!” </p>
			<p>Killing intent shot up into the skies as the disciples of the Zhu Family heard what he said.</p>
			<p>“That’s them! That freak who doesn’t look like a human nor a ghost killed Brother Zhu Ding!” Zhu Yuan growled.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chenlong turned around to glare at Zhu Ding’s murderer, but when he saw Lord Gui Chi’s face, the rage in his heart turned into smoke. His expression changed drastically.</p>
			<p>Before he could say a word, Gui Chi waved his hand again. Devils filled the air and the Zhu Lan City turned into hell on earth. The devils pounced at the disciples of the Zhu Family.</p>
			<p>Zhu Yuan cried out in fright, and the experts who were behind Zhu Chenlong were about to make their move when they were stopped by him.</p>
			<p>“Hold it right there!” Zhu Chenlong cried.</p>
			<p>The experts of the Zhu Family were shocked and looked at Zhu Chenlong in surprise.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chenlong ignored them as he walked over to Huang Xiaolong and Gui Chi. He bowed respectfully to Gui Chi. “Zhu Chenlong of the Zhu Family greets Lord Gui Chi!”𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p>He then turned to Jian Wushuang. “I greet Lord Jian Wushuang!” </p>
			<p>Then, he turned to Wu Xin and the rest.</p>
			<p>“I greet the Limitless Master!” </p>
			<p>“I greet Your Majesty, the King of the Ocean Race!” </p>
			<p>“I greet Your Majesty, Yu Xiaohong!” </p>
			<p>The experts of the Zhu Family felt their jaws dropping in fright.</p>
			<p>Chen Bi and the disciples of the Chen Family couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chenlong, a venerated eminent elder of the Zhu Family, bowed to each and every one of the slaves who followed that kid around!</p>
			<p>Wait! What did he just call them?!</p>
			<p>“Lord… Lord Gui Chi?!” Chen Bi gasped. “Lord… Lord Jian Wushuang!” </p>
			<p>There was the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race too!</p>
			<p>Moreover, the young lady he tried to flirt with was Yu Xiaohong, the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!</p>
			<p>Cold sweat drenched his back.</p>
			<p>As for the disciples around him, their souls had left their body in fright.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong casually turned his head to stare at Chen Bi all of a sudden. Falling to his knees, Chen Bi’s excitement from breaking through to the God of Creation Realm was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>Ancestors Chen Bi, Du Chengjiang, and Xu Fei fell to their knees in fear too. Even though they didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong was, they knew he was an existence scarier than their worst nightmare! </p>
			<p>Even existences at the level of Gui Chi and Jian Wushuang had to follow behind him respectfully! How in the world was that man from a third rate power?! </p>
			<p>The experts standing around fell to their knees too. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Chenlong while Zhu Yuan’s screams rang through the air.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chenlong felt his body freezing up when Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on him.</p>
			<p>A horrifying pressure surged out from Huang Xiaolong’s body all of a sudden, and the city trembled in its wake. It was as though the city came under attack as every single protection formation activated. Beams of light shot into the air.</p>
			<p>The weight of the universe seemed to descend on Zhu Chenlong and he was forced flat onto the ground. The blood drained from his face and he turned deathly pale.</p>
			<p>Just one second ago, he was silently trying to estimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength. No matter how much he tried to overestimate the strength of the man before him, he didn’t expect himself to be wrong!</p>
			<p>Even if Zhu Chen used his full strength, he might not be as terrifying as the young man before him!</p>
			<p>Wouldn’t that mean that the youngster was even stronger than the old ancestor of the Zhu Family?!</p>
			<p>“I didn’t know which Lord came to my Zhu Lan City. I, Zhu Ji, apologize for not coming out to welcome you.” A voice emerged from the depths of the Zhu Lan Palace.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji!</p>
			<p>The Zhu Lan Celestial Emperor and the patriarch of the Zhu Family, Zhu Ji!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3664: Breaking the Formation</p>
			</title>
			<p>On the surface, Zhu Qiming of the Zhu Family was the most talented disciple of the Zhu Family’s second generation. He was also said to be the strongest! However, many experts knew that that was false. The one who was the strongest in the second generation of the Zhu Family was Zhu Ji!</p>
			<p>The only reason he didn’t stand out was because he hated being in the limelight.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji might not be as strong as Mei Jie, but he wasn’t too far off.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Come out here if you wish to speak to me!” </p>
			<p>He might not be loud, but his words seemed to contain a formless pressure that made everyone submit.</p>
			<p>The marshals in the Zhu Lan Palace raged when they heard what he said.</p>
			<p>One of them roared with anger, “How dare you speak down to His Majesty? Who do you think you are? If you have the guts, come into our palace!” </p>
			<p>The Zhu Lan Palace was created by Zhu Chen and the various experts of the Zhu Family after expanding a huge amount of resources. The marshal who spoke was sure that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to barge his way in! That was the basis of his confidence.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t react too much. He simply reached his hand into the void and stretched into the Zhu Lan Palace. </p>
			<p>As soon as he did, the grand formations in the palace reacted. A myriad of lights burst through the void and extended through countless layers of space.</p>
			<p>A horrifying pressure shot straight towards Huang Xiaolong and his group.</p>
			<p>One had to say that the power contained in the formations caused Jian Wushuang and the rest to be slightly taken aback.</p>
			<p>It was indeed strong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snorted lightly and the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared. Rays of starlight fell and blocked off the shockwaves from the formations.</p>
			<p>Next, he clenched his fists tightly after it reached into the palace. The resistance put up by the barrier was crushed by him. </p>
			<p>Zhu Ji panicked instantly. “Star Dragon Divine Tree?! Experts of the Zhu Family and subjects of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire, listen to my commands! Assist the formation immediately and resist the enemy attack!” </p>
			<p>Everyone in the palace poured their grand cosmos energy into the formation and pillars of light emerged to stop Huang Xiaolong’s palm.</p>
			<p>Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong finally focused.</p>
			<p>The experts in the palace heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that they successfully stopped the enemy.</p>
			<p>The marshal who had taunted Huang Xiaolong earlier relaxed instantly.</p>
			<p>He continued arrogantly, “Hah! What did I tell you! The grand formation was laid down by Lord Zhu Chen personally! It combines the power of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire and the surrounding heaven and earth qi! Not even the Dragon Overlord can force his way in here! You’re overestimating yourself!” </p>
			<p>“F*ck off back to your mother’s womb and drink your milk!” </p>
			<p>“When Lord Zhu Chen returns, you’re dead!” </p>
			<p>The marshal who was yelling wasn’t anyone special. Instead, it was Zhu Chen’s second son, Zhu Yao! He was the fifth strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire!</p>
			<p>Zhu Yao’s words caused a round of laughter to ring through the palace.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Jian Wushuang’s face and he was just about to join in the assault when he was stopped by Huang Xiaolong. “Stay back.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong turned serious as he looked at the palace and Jian Wushuang and the others quickly retreated behind him.</p>
			<p>Rising into the air, Huang Xiaolong hovered above the palace as the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand. His 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out of his body in a massive tide as a golden glow surrounded his weapon. The world turned completely golden and everyone squinted their eyes to adapt to the sudden dazzle.</p>
			<p>“Three… Three Gods Halberd!” Zhu Ji cried.</p>
			<p>The young man who appeared out of nowhere actually had the Star Dragon Divine Tree and Three Gods Halberd!</p>
			<p>Not a single one of the five overlords had more than one universe treasure!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about Zhu Ji’s surprise. When the rays around the halberd reached its peak intensity, he threw it at the palace.𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p>It turned into a streak of light and it shot towards the Zhu Lan Palace with a terrifying force.</p>
			<p>It looked like a massive sun that soared through the air. The space around the halberd crumbled into pieces instantly.</p>
			<p>The city shook violently under the might of Huang Xiaolong’s attack.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji’s expression changed once again. He no longer held back and pushed the grand cosmos energy in his body to the limit. He waved the Zhu Lan Blade and roared, “Full power! We have to hold on!” </p>
			<p>The blade in his hand swept out and created countless blade lights that shot towards the Three Gods Halberd. </p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang was taken aback by Zhu Ji’s blade intent. From the looks of it, Zhu Ji’s blade intent was comparable to his own! In the future, Zhu Ji might just surpass him!</p>
			<p>Buzz!</p>
			<p>The blade intent crashed into the Three Gods Halberd but it was completely useless! It shattered into pieces and the Three Gods Halberd continued straight for the palace. </p>
			<p>Before the halberd could arrive, everyone within felt the horrifying pressure coming from it. </p>
			<p>Under their frightened gaze, the halberd smashed into the grand formation.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>The blast reverberated through the city and cracks started to form on the ground below.</p>
			<p>Along with the loud blast, the experts in the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire felt their dao souls leap out of their bodies. They spat out a mouthful of blood and those who were weaker had blood leaking from all their orifices.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji and Zhu Yao were naturally unable to avoid their terrible fate. They vomited blood non-stop.</p>
			<p>The Three Gods Halberd stabbed deep into the formation and turned everything around it to dust. </p>
			<p>In the blink of an eye, the powerful grand formation dimmed and the faces of everyone in the palace were filled with shock. The grand formation was torn apart!</p>
			<p>Chen Bi had long since fainted, but no one knew if it was from fright or from the pressure coming from the halberd.</p>
			<p>Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Roots and branches extended all over the city and locked down the entire area. Huang Xiaolong took a single step and entered the palace.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3665: Zhu Chen’s Location</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sauntered into the main hall of the palace and arrived before Zhu Ji and Zhu Yao. The various experts of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire were also present.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Yao who was stained red with blood and he dragged the man over to himself.</p>
			<p>“Who the hell are you?! What do you want?!” Zhu Ji roared in fright and anger. “You dare to harm my second brother… Once Lord Father returns, he won’t let you off!” </p>
			<p>“Zhu Chen won’t let me off?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow. “Do you think your father is my opponent?”</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji stared at him in silence.</p>
			<p>Turning to Zhu Yao, Huang Xiaolong snorted. “Go back to my mother? Weren’t you jumping around just a moment ago claiming that I won’t be able to break your grand formation?” </p>
			<p>The blood drained from Zhu Yao’s face. He truly didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would be able to break through the grand formation. He had seen the power of the formation. His father, Zhu Chen, said that even the Dragon Overlord wouldn’t be able to break through forcefully!</p>
			<p>Who would have thought that an unknown expert would be able to do so?!</p>
			<p>He suppressed his shock and growled, “You only relied on your weapon to destroy the formation. Hmph, you wouldn’t be able to do a thing to us otherwise! You’re nobody without your weapon!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. “If I’m nobody without my weapon, who are you without Zhu Chen’s formation?” </p>
			<p>Zhu Yao was dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>“What else do you have to say?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>Zhu Yao stuttered, but no words came out of his mouth.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip on Zhu Yao and the latter’s body was crushed. Despite his creation level armor and physical body that was stronger than many half-step Universe Gods, he was still turned into a mist of blood.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong held the other party’s dao soul and tossed it into the Sun Moon Furnace.𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>The members of the Zhu Family flew into rage when they saw what happened to Zhu Yao.</p>
			<p>“You!” Zhu Ji jumped into the air and roared with anger.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong pressed down on the air in front of him and crushed the Zhu Lan Celestial Emperor into the ground.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>Several days later, Huang Xiaolong looked down at the Zhu Lan City as he stood in the skies above. </p>
			<p>In the days that passed, he managed to gain control over the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire.</p>
			<p>Several moments later, Zhu Ji appeared behind Huang Xiaolong and he bowed respectfully, “Lord…” </p>
			<p>“Is there news on your father?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>Zhu Ji shook his head and bowed slightly, “No, there isn’t.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong frowned. He had been getting Zhu Ji to contact Zhu Chen in the days that passed, but he failed to receive a reply. He didn’t even know what Zhu Chen went to the Green Ghost Lands for! He only knew that his father went to search for something.</p>
			<p>Alas. Zhu Chen didn’t say anything about the item he was searching for. Huang Xiaolong expected him to reply to Zhu Ji’s reports, but he was wrong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Ji about other matters before dismissing him.</p>
			<p>After Zhu Ji left, Gui Chi, Jian Wushuang, and the others appeared beside him.</p>
			<p>“Lord, is there still no news about Zhu Chen?” Jian Wushuang asked.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly.</p>
			<p>“Why don’t we go over to Fengdu City to search for him?” Jian Wushuang probed.</p>
			<p>Gui Chi cackled happily, “Alright! I’m extremely familiar with the city!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before sighing, “We won’t be heading there for now…” </p>
			<p>The actions he took in the Unknown Lands were growing larger and larger. The chances of him exposing himself were huge! He needed to raise his strength before the Ferocious Devil and the others started to put up their guards against him. </p>
			<p>He could only put aside the Zhu Chen matter for the time being.</p>
			<p>Of course, he could cultivate in the Zhu Lan Palace while waiting for Zhu Chen to reappear.</p>
			<p>Naturally, he got Jian Wushuang and the others to continue monitoring for news on Zhu Chen.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sent Wu Xin and Ye Ye back to their respective territories. Even Gui Chi was sent back to the Green Ghost Lands! He didn’t want to arouse the Green Ghost’s suspicion, especially before he dealt with the other overlords!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Yu Xiaohong and chuckled softly, “You should go back too…”</p>
			<p>She lowered her head and whispered softly, “I wish to stay by your side…” </p>
			<p>“The situation in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire isn’t stable yet. You should go back and handle matters. You can come back when it’s all been dealt with. After all, my seclusion this time will take a couple million years.” Huang Xiaolong explained.</p>
			<p>He had more than eight hundred universe-level spiritual veins after the battle in the Jian Family. With those in the Zhu Family’s treasury, he gathered more than a thousand.</p>
			<p>According to his estimations, he would need at least a million years in seclusion to digest all of them!</p>
			<p>Yu Xiaohong only nodded after learning that he would enter seclusion for a long time. </p>
			<p>As night fell, Huang Xiaolong remained in the depths of the Zhu Lan Palace.</p>
			<p>Naturally, he remained in the second layer of the universe boat. He chose ten strands of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and tossed it into the eye of the formation. He started to circulate his Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art and devoured the universe qi in the air around him.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong was cultivating in seclusion, Zhu Chen looked at a blood-red bridge before him and he hesitated slightly. He was currently in one of the spaces contained in the Green Ghost Lands.</p>
			<p>He saw weird movement on the bridge, and it seemed as though bloodworms were tunneling around the place. If he looked closely at it, they seemed to resemble blood runes.</p>
			<p>The bridge led into a deep abyss that no one could see the end of. Occasionally, creepy laughter would come from the depths.</p>
			<p>“Naihe Bridge…” Zhu Chen muttered to himself.</p>
			<p>If anyone were to hear the words that left his lips, the blood would drain out of their face immediately. The Naihe Bridge was the most terrifying forbidden ground in the Unknown Lands! No one knows what lied at the end of the bridge, but they were sure that leaving after reaching the end was something impossible! The Green Ghost attempted it once in the past and when he finally emerged, he said that he would never enter ever again! From the fear he held for the bridge, anyone could tell the terrors it held!</p>
			<p>“There’s no reward without risk…” Zhu Chen seemed to have made up his mind. He took a bold step onto the Naihe Bridge and the moment he did, a blood wave that was countless miles high rushed towards him. Zhu Chen felt as though he had stepped into an endless hell as the squirming runes on the bridge converged at his location.</p>
			<p>A light surrounded his body as he forced the squirming creatures back.</p>
			<p>The bloodworms that were on the ground ate through the grand cosmos energy around him and he continued on his way forward. The deeper he went, the stronger the corrosive ability.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3666: Ferocious Devil’s Strength!</p>
			</title>
			<p>Zhu Chen’s figure slowly entered the depths of the Naihe Bridge. </p>
			<p>In the blink of an eye, two million years passed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had long since refined all the universe-level spiritual veins he had. In fact, he completed the refinement several hundred thousand years ago. His grand cosmos energy was stuck at the 26.99999 billion mark.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on his face all of a sudden as he stopped his cultivation.</p>
			<p>He failed to break through no matter how hard he tried. Even after hundreds of thousands of years of comprehension, there were no signs of breaking through!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sighed and he knew that his shallow foundation was the reason behind it.</p>
			<p>All these years, he had been using the universe qi in the Universe Boat to cultivate and he experienced tremendous success. His speed was shockingly fast, but the amount of experience he had was too little! He didn’t truly understand the laws of the universe.</p>
			<p>He had been comprehending the laws of the universe whenever he cultivated, but that was far from enough! The laws of the universe would bash against his dao heart from time to time and if he wasn’t careful, his dao heart would shatter!</p>
			<p>The principle behind it was like a skyscraper without proper foundations! </p>
			<p>Luckily for him, he had ridded himself of the hidden dangers when he devoured the bloodlines of Huang Sheng and the others. Otherwise, he would be in much more danger!</p>
			<p>Several moments later, he left the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>The next thing he had to do was to continue to comprehend the laws of the universe. He also had to consolidate his foundations before he could break through to the peak of the grand completion stage!</p>
			<p>The more he understood the universe laws, the more he realized that the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and the Pangu World Creation Art couldn’t keep up with his cultivation. Any one of them lagged far behind Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Manual!</p>
			<p>They were even slightly worse than the cultivation methods used by Yu Xiaohong and cultivators who had broken through the 10 billion units mark.</p>
			<p>As such, Huang Xiaolong decided to gather the techniques of the stronger cultivators under him to try to comprehend three more suitable techniques for himself!</p>
			<p>Whatever the case, it wouldn’t be easy for him to do so. Even with his shocking talent, he couldn’t do it in a short period of time!</p>
			<p>Despite that, he was in no rush. With his current strength, he was more than enough to hold off the entire Unknown Lands himself. </p>
			<p>No matter if it was the Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, or the God of Death, none of them would be able to put up a fight against him!</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost’s combat strength was at 25 billion units! With Huang Xiaolong’s numerous universe treasures, his combat strength far surpassed the 27 billion units mark!</p>
			<p>The only person who Huang Xiaolong feared was the Ferocious Devil!</p>
			<p>From Jian Wushuang, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Ferocious Devil was the reason behind the Unknown Lands surviving the tribulation that destroyed the thirteen universes. </p>
			<p>It was said that the Ferocious Devil blocked off more than ninety percent of the power that was used to destroy the universes!</p>
			<p>His strength should have far surpassed the 27 billion units mark! </p>
			<p>One had to know that the power that nearly destroyed everything in the past was close to an attack from a Universe God. Huang Xiaolong knew how strong someone with 27 billion units of combat strength was. It was far from enough to do what the Ferocious Devil did.</p>
			<p>Of course, Huang Xiaolong feared the Ferocious Devil, but he was still confident of holding him off.</p>
			<p>No matter how strong the old devil was, he wouldn’t be able to destroy the Universe Boat!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong summoned Jian Wushuang Zhu Ji to ask them about the recent happenings and to ask about news on Zhu Chen. </p>
			<p>The two of them shook their heads slowly.</p>
			<p>“Is there still no news on him?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.</p>
			<p>Two million years had passed and Zhu Chen was nowhere to be seen! He didn’t even send a single message!</p>
			<p>“No…” Zhu Ji sighed. “Ever since my father entered the Fengdu City, he seemed to have disappeared.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Is it possible for him to leave the city?” </p>
			<p>“It’s hard to say…” Jian Wushuang added. “Lord, why don’t I go over to the Fengdu City to take a look?” </p>
			<p>“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong rejected his suggestion. “Let me go alone.” 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p>“Alone?” Jian Wushuang and Zhu Ji were slightly stunned.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “There’s nothing wrong with it. The Fengdu City isn’t the Worldless Linluo Hell. Even if it is, I’ll be able to return safely.” </p>
			<p>The two of them nodded slowly.</p>
			<p>“Where’s Han’er?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Jian Wushuang and asked.</p>
			<p>Jian Wushuang laughed, “In the years you were in seclusion, Han’er entered seclusion too. She refused to leave her cultivation chamber and wanted to close the gap between your strength. If you wish to see her, I’ll summon her. She will be elated to learn that you have left seclusion.” </p>
			<p>“Alright. Please let her know.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.</p>
			<p>This time, he would head over to the Fengdu City. All would be well if he found Zhu Chen. If he didn’t, Huang Xiaolong would change his target to the Dragon Overlord. He wouldn’t be able to return for some time. If Tao Han’er knew that he didn’t look for her after he left seclusion, she would feel neglected.</p>
			<p>“Alright. I’ll tell her now.” Jian Wushuang turned to leave.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for Tao Han’er to arrive. She was clad in a pure white dress and she exuded an air of calmness and elegance around her.</p>
			<p>“Lord!” Tao Han’er grinned and ran over. “You finally left seclusion!” </p>
			<p>“Yep. I heard from your grandpa that you had been in seclusion all these years. I didn’t bother you, did I?” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p>A cute giggle left Tao Han’er’s lips. “I’ll like it if you bother me more…” </p>
			<p>She looked at Huang Xiaolong with puppy-like eyes after speaking.</p>
			<p>Coughing twice, Huang Xiaolong turned, only to see Jian Wushuang and Zhu Ji looking up at the sky.</p>
			<p>“Alright, the two of you can leave. I’ll call for you if something comes up.” Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>Acknowledging with a slight bow, they left. No one knew if Huang Xiaolong was mistaking things, but he thought he saw Jian Wushuang winking at his granddaughter as he left.</p>
			<p>“Lord Huang, I heard from my grandfather that you plan to head to the Fengdu City.” Tao Han’er continued, “Can I follow you?” </p>
			<p>An eager expression hung on her face as she continued, “I’m not weak any more! I should be able to remain in the city for some time!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes slightly. It seemed as though she had been cultivating hard the past two million years to gain enough power to resist the corrosive energy in the Fengdu City.</p>
			<p>After so many years, her strength did experience an earth shaking transformation! She started to comprehend the elements, and he could tell that she had already started her comprehension on time and space!</p>
			<p>Among the thirteen elements, time and space proved to be the most difficult elements to comprehend. Even so, she understood how they worked!</p>

			<p> Huang Xiaolong could also tell that she had probably reached the small completion in both elements! </p>
			<p> In a short two million years, Tao Han’er was able to improve so quickly! Hard work had a part to play, but her talent was a much greater factor! Also, the reason she could comprehend the power of time and space so quickly was because Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Sword Manual contained both elements. </p>
			<p> “I’m going to look for Zhu Chen and I’m also planning to go to the Dragon Lands after. It won’t be convenient for you to follow me this time.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. </p>
			<p> Tao Han’er’s gaze dimmed slightly. </p>
			<p> “Next time.” Huang Xiaolong added. “When I return, I’ll bring you to the Fengdu City if you wish to experience life there.” </p>
			<p> “Really?!” Tao Han’er’s eyes lit up again. </p>
			<p> “Of course.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> “Alright! We’ll pinky promise!” Tao Han’er jumped in excitement and she stretched out her slender finger. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly and he hooked pinkies with her.  </p>
			<p> It had been a long time since he had heard of a pinky promise. </p>
			<p> “Lord, if you have nothing else left to do, let’s go out for a walk!” Tao Han’er asked. </p>
			<p> Looking at her smile, he couldn’t refuse. He nodded slowly. “Alright. I’ve been in the Zhu Lan City for so long but I haven’t got the chance to explore it!” </p>
			<p> “Me too, me too! I won’t be able to find my way around if I went alone…” Tao Han’er bounced up and down like a little excited child. </p>

			<p> “Then… I’ll get Zhu Ji to bring us around? He should be familiar with his city.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “No!” Tao Han’er refused immediately. “The two of us are more than enough! We won’t get lost anyway…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong snickered silently in response, “Sure. Let’s go then!” </p>
			<p> The two of them left the palace and went strolling around the streets of the city. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stayed for a few more days, and he would bring Tao Han’er around the city when the sun was up. At night, he would look for Jian Wushuang, Zhu Ji, and the experts who had broken through the 10 billion units mark to exchange pointers. Even though it had only been a few days, Huang Xiaolong gained some understanding of their special techniques. </p>
			<p> Several days later… </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong left the city under the respectful gazes of Zhu Ji and the rest. As for Tao Han’er, she hid in a corner of the palace and she looked at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure. </p>
			<p> He eventually disappeared into the horizon. </p>
			<p> After leaving the city, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Universe Boat. The distance between the Zhu Lan Lands and the Green Ghost Lands was enormous! He needed countless years in order to arrive. 𝙛𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> Sitting in the formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong started to comprehend the secret arts of the various experts. </p>
			<p> Through the exchange he had with them in the past few days, he managed to comprehend quite a bit! </p>
			<p> Unknowingly, countless years passed. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat crossed several large continents and he arrived at the Green Ghost Lands! </p>
			<p> Standing on top of the Universe Boat, he looked at the vast land mass below. </p>
			<p> After entering the Green Ghost Lands, Huang Xiaolong realized that everything around him had turned a dull shade of gray. The sunlight that illuminated the other continents was nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p> There were also occasional roars coming from the distance. </p>
			<p> The Green Ghost Lands and the Land of Death were the two most messy continents in the Unknown Lands. One could witness battles going on everywhere, and there was no such thing as law. Cultivators who were traveling around would run into ghosts ever so often. </p>
			<p> The ghosts they ran into were called Yin Ghosts, and they were ghost-like creatures with human features. They used something called ghost energy, and they were extremely afraid of sunlight. </p>
			<p> Of course, yin ghosts weren’t the only creatures that populated the Green Ghost Lands. There were human races who lived there too. Seventy percent of the population of the Green Ghost Lands was made up of yin ghosts, twenty percent was made up of humans, and the last ten percent was made up of some weird creatures called ghost beasts. </p>
			<p> The beasts born in the Green Ghost Lands wielded ghost energy and they greatly resembled ghosts, hence the name. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaoong to see a massive city. After thinking about it, he kept his Universe Boat and descended. </p>
			<p> “Nanfeng City…” Huang Xiaolong looked at the plaque on the city gates before walking in. </p>
			<p> The city wasn’t as deserted as Huang Xiaolong had thought. It was comparable to the large cities in the Limitless Lands and the Zhu Lan Lands. The city was bustling, and there were many people strolling about! The buildings in the city weren’t weird at all! Inns, shops, entertainment pavilions, they had it all! </p>
			<p> The only difference from the other regions was that the city was shrouded in a gray mist. There wasn’t a trace of sunlight, resulting in a type of oppressive atmosphere. </p>
			<p> “I heard that the Yin Ghost River is starting to flood!” </p>
			<p> “What?! The Yin Ghost River that had remained dry for billions of years finally started to fill up!” </p>
			<p> “Yeah! The city master of our Nanfeng City and the city masters all around are heading there as we speak! I heard that many Ghost Kings and even Lord Nether Yang King have started to make their way there!” </p>
			<p> “Even Lord Nether Yang King has been alerted!” </p>
			<p> The master of the Green Ghost Lands was the Green Ghost, and Gui Chi was the sole expert under him. There were ten great kings under Gui Chi, and the Nether Yang King was one of them! </p>
			<p> “The flooding of the Yin Ghost River is an amazing opportunity! We have to go there!”  </p>
			<p> “Heh… It’s not that easy to enter the river. I’m just a Dao Venerable who comprehended two elements to the grand completion stage. If something goes wrong, I’ll turn into a yin spirit that roams the river forever!” </p>
			<p> The discussion from the cultivators around him entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. Yin Ghost River? </p>
			<p> He knew about it. It was one of the secret regions of the Unknown Lands. It would only fill up every few billion years, and the water that filled it would be yin spirit waster! </p>
			<p> When that happened, anyone who could cross the river to reach the other side would be able to obtain a rare treasure! There were legends of people who comprehended supreme techniques after reaching the other side, and there were some who obtained rare treasures! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stopped the cultivators of several great families and tossed over several grand dao pills to ask about the matters regarding the river. </p>
			<p> After receiving the pills, they revealed everything they knew! </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you headed to the Yin Ghost River too?” One person in the crowd laughed. “If you don’t mind, I can bring you there!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong glanced at the man from the corner of his eye and agreed. “Sure.” </p>
			<p> As such, the two of them left the city for the Yin Ghost River.</p>

			</title>
			<p> “What is your name?” Huang Xiaolong asked as they left the city. </p>
			<p> “Lord, my name is Jiang Dacheng. I am an eminent elder of the Jiang Family.” The man who volunteered to bring Huang Xiaolong to the Yin Ghost River replied hastily. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. Jiang Dacheng had comprehended three elements to the grand perfection level, and he should be from some tiny family in some celestial empire in the Green Ghost Lands. </p>
			<p> “I wonder which family Lord comes from?” Jiang Dacheng asked cautiously. “I don’t mean any disrespect! I was just curious!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’m not from the Green Ghost Lands.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng gasped in fright. “Not from the Green Ghost Lands? Do you mean… You came from other continents?” </p>
			<p> He didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would actually be able to cross the continents to arrive at their Green Ghost Lands. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Are you surprised?” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng scratched his head in embarrassment and chuckled, “Yeah. Not many people will come to our Green Ghost Lands. Lord, did you come for the Yin Ghost River?”  </p>
			<p> Find the original at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> “Nope.” Huang Xiaolong replied casually. “I wanted to look for someone in the Fengdu City. I ran into news of the Yin Ghost River on the way and decided to check it out.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng laughed along with Huang Xiaolong, “So that’s the case… Lord, you came at the right time! The Yin Ghost River only fills up every billions of years! If you reach the other side, you might be able to obtain some supreme treasures or opportunities!” </p>
			<p> “Haha, alright! If I manage to get anything good, I’ll reward you heavily!” </p>
			<p> “I’ll thank you in advance then!” Jiang Dacheng said casually. He didn’t think that it was possible for Huang Xiaolong to obtain anything good, but he accepted the other party’s good intentions. </p>
			<p> “Lord, when we arrive at the Yin Ghost River, you must remember not to clash with the experts of other clans.” Jiang Dacheng reminded Huang Xiaolong earnestly. “There are countless experts who arrived this time. Even the Ghost Kings and old ancestors of the ancient races have come. Lord Nether Yang King and his son came this time too!” </p>
			<p> In the Green Ghost Lands, Ghost Kings referred to experts at the God of Creation Realm. </p>
			<p> “Is the Nether Yang King strong?” Huang Xiaolong smiled. </p>
			<p> A solemn expression appeared on Jiang Dacheng’s face when he heard the Ghost King’s title. A heated gaze appeared in his eyes. “Of course he is! Lord Nether Yang King is super strong. He’s the strongest person in the Green Ghost Lands!” </p>
			<p> “Strongest person in the Green Ghost Lands?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually. “Isn’t the Green Ghost the strongest expert here?” </p>
			<p> An awkward chuckle left Jiang Dacheng’s lips. “Of course Lord Green Ghost is an exception! He hasn’t appeared in a long time! There are even some who say that Lord Green Ghost left the Green Ghost Lands some time ago. Other than Lord Green Ghost and Lord Gui Chi, Nether Yang King and the other ten kings are the strongest experts here!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong said half jokingly, “Since he’s so strong, I have to get a taste of his power later…” 𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> The blood drained from Jiang Dacheng’s face instantly. He jumped in fright, “Lord, you most definitely cannot! Lord Nether Yang King’s strength is something we cannot imagine! You must not infuriate him! Otherwise, no one will be able to save you! Lord Nether Yang King can kill half-step Universe Gods with a wave of his arms!” </p>
			<p> “Those are half-step Universe Gods we’re talking about! Do you know how strong they are?!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed when he saw the terrified expression on Jiang Dacheng’s face. “Relax. I was joking! Why would I piss him off for no reason?” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> Several days later, the two of them arrived. </p>
			<p> Looking at one of the riverbanks, countless experts of the Green Ghost Lands piled high on top of each other. </p>
			<p> There were yin ghosts, humans, and ghost beasts ready to start their attempt to cross the river! </p>
			<p> The humans gathered around each other, and the yin ghosts found an area of their own. The ghost beasts huddled around each other, away from the other two. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the river and noticed a giant empty spot. There was only a young man and a group of experts standing behind him. No one dared to approach the group. </p>
			<p> When Jiang Dacheng saw that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over, his heart nearly leaped out of his chest. “Lord, you can’t go there!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Why not?” </p>
			<p> “Those are members of the Yin Ghost Race. I know one of them! He’s the son of the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Heavenly Blood Ghost King is the overlord of the area and he’s a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage!” </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Huang Xiaolong grunted once and continued to make his way over. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng was shocked and he wanted to pull Huang Xiaolong back, but he missed. </p>
			<p> “Hold it right there!” The experts of the Yin Ghost Race yelled when they saw Huang Xiaolong heading towards them. “Brat, this place belongs to Young Master Yue Qing! If you come one step closer, you better not blame us for throwing you into the river to feed the spirits!” </p>
			<p> As the Yin Ghost River continued to rise, terrifying yin spirits would appear from time to time. They wouldn’t come up to the shore, but if anyone fell in, they would be devoured down to the last bone. Experts who fell in wouldn’t be able to return back to shore easily and in the end, they would also become yin spirits that roamed the river. </p>
			<p> No one wouldn’t be terrified of the yin spirits.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong ignored them all as he continued to make his way over. </p>
			<p> The experts standing around gasped in shock. </p>
			<p> “Which family is he from? Is he crazy or deaf?” </p>
			<p> “He might actually be deaf!” </p>
			<p> Many people joked. </p>
			<p> As the group of experts from the Yin Ghost Race saw Huang Xiaolong ignore their warnings, one of them reached over to throw him into the river. </p>
			<p> Before he could touch Huang Xiaolong, he flew backwards and landed into the river himself. </p>
			<p> As soon as he did, countless yin spirits swarmed him. They devoured him whole as his miserable screams rang through the air. </p>
			<p> Widening their eyes in shock, the young man who was looking at the other side of the river turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. The person who flew into the water just a second ago was his subordinate, and it was one of his most loyal subordinates! </p>
			<p> Yue Qing’s expression sank.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3669 – Yin Soul Ghost Ship&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng’s face turned as pale as a sheet when he saw what happened to the expert of the Yin Ghost Race. Even though he didn’t see Huang Xiaolong doing it, he knew that Huang Xiaolong was behind it. </p>
			<p> Yue Qing glared at Huang Xiaolong and he growlede, “You’re asking for death!” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, he started to walk towards the man. </p>
			<p> One of the youngsters beside Yue Qing stopped him suddenly. “Wait!” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> “Get someone to check his background.” The youngster who stopped him whispered. </p>
			<p> With his expression fluctuating slightly, Yue Qing eventually nodded and signaled to his subordinates. </p>
			<p> The experts who were about to leap at Huang Xiaolong backed down. </p>
			<p> “I wonder which family you come from?” The youngster who stopped Yue Qing asked Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Ignoring the youngster, Huang Xiaolong kept his gaze fixed on the other side of the river. </p>
			<p> The youngster frowned when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t paying attention to him. </p>
			<p> “Brother Qi Wei, that human is too arrogant!” Yue Qing gnashed his teeth. “There’s no need to investigate his identity any more! I’ll kill him right now! He’s just a mere human! There’s no need to be afraid of him!” </p>
			<p> The youngster called Qi Wei shook his head in response. “There’s no rush. Wait for our fathers to come before dealing with him.” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing could only agree reluctantly. </p>
			<p> Standing at the riverbank, Huang Xiaolong saw that the Yin Ghost River was almost filled. </p>
			<p> In the legends, ghost ships would appear when the river was filled. One could only cross the river if they got on board those ships. </p>
			<p> Those who failed to board a ghost ship would never be able to cross the river. </p>
			<p> Green Ghost tried it in the past, and he failed to reach the other side. </p>
			<p> Those who arrived were waiting quietly for the river to fill up and the ghost ships to arrive. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw Jiang Dacheng standing over there in a daze. A chuckle left his lips, “Why don’t you come over here too?” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng gashed his teeth after looking at Yue Qing and the rest. He eventually chose to head over to Huang Xiaolong’s side. </p>
			<p> The experts in the surroundings glared at Jiang Dacheng as though they wanted to eat him alive. Despite their hostility, Yue Qing remained silent and none of them moved against Jiang Dacheng. </p>
			<p> When Jiang Dacheng arrived behind Huang Xiaolong, he bowed respectfully, “Lord…” </p>
			<p> “Follow me up the ship later.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘣𝘯𝑜𝓋𝘦𝑙.𝒸𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> A joyful expression formed on Jiang Dacheng’s face and he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely. </p>
			<p> There were limited spaces on board a ghost ship. Not anyone could board one! For cultivators like Jiang Dacheng who only comprehended three elements to the grand perfection level, he would never get a chance to board a ghost ship. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was giving him a massive chance! </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng celebrated in his heart and thought that he should cherish the opportunity given to him. </p>
			<p> In the distance, Yue Qing glared at Jiang Dacheng and asked his subordinates, “Which family is that guy from?” </p>
			<p> They quickly came back with a reply. </p>
			<p> “Oh? Jiang Family of the Nanfeng City?” Yue Qing thought about it for a moment before muttering, “His ancestor should be someone called Jiang Shuping.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Shuping paid his respects to Yue Qing during one of the many banquets in the past. </p>
			<p> With Jiang Shuping’s cultivation at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm, he wasn’t qualified to hold Yue Qing’s shoes! </p>
			<p> “That’s the one…” His subordinate replied. </p>
			<p> A chilly light flashed in Yue Qing’s eyes and he growled, “His ancestor doesn’t even have the ability to pour my tea. How dare a little eminent elder of his family stand against me?” </p>

			<p> “Young Master, should we call Jiang Shuping over?” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing harrumphed coldly, “Yes. Tell him to get his *ss over here right now. Tell him I wish to meet him. I want him to skin that eminent elder alive.” </p>
			<p> The subordinate bowed respectfully before sending the order to Jiang Shuping. </p>
			<p> The moment Jiang Shuping received the order, he handed over all his responsibilities and rushed over from the Nanfeng City. </p>
			<p> Half an hour later… </p>
			<p> The river was almost completely filled. </p>
			<p> “Lord, the Yin Ghost River should be completely filled in another half an hour.” Jiang Dacheng whispered into Huang Xiaolong’s ear. He couldn’t help but start to panic when he saw the ever rising surface of water. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong smiled. “There’s no need to be anxious. As long as you’re with me, you’ll definitely be able to reach the other side.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng rubbed his head in embarrassment, “I haven’t been there before. I heard that there’s a Sword Grave on the other side.” </p>
			<p> “Are you looking for a good sword?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng nodded solemnly.”I’m someone who loves the dao of the sword and a good sword is all I ask for!” </p>
			<p> “Since that’s the case, I’ll bring you there later.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng celebrated in his heart. It was extremely difficult to obtain a sword from the Sword Grave on the other side of the Yin Ghost River. With Huang Xiaolong around, things might become much easier! However, he hesitated slightly after thinking about it. “Will I hold the lord back with my request?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, “Of course not. Even if it will, you won’t take up too much time.” </p>
			<p> “Lord, you said that you were planning to go to the Fengdu City to look for someone. I wonder who it is?” Jiang Dacheng asked all of a sudden. “Fengdu City is extremely dangerous! Moreover, the journey there is long. Lord, it’s dangerous to travel alone.” </p>
			<p> A mischievous glint flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Oh. You should know the person I’m looking for.” </p>
			<p> “I do?” Jiang Dacheng was taken aback. </p>
			<p> “He’s called Zhu Chen.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng’s eyes widened in fright. “Lord Zhu Chen? Are you talking about Lord Zhu Chen, the master of the Zhu Lan Lands?” </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> “Why do you need to look for Lord Zhu Chen?” Jiang Dacheng asked. “Lord, do you wish to beg him for something?” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing in response. “Beg him for something? Of course not. I’m going to beat him up until he agrees to be my subordinate.”  </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. He didn’t recover for a long time. </p>
			<p> “Lord… You must be kidding…” Jiang Dacheng returned to reality after a long time and he forced a smile. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong smiled while remaining silent. </p>
			<p> Half an hour later, the Yin Ghost River was completely filled up! </p>
			<p> “Look! It’s a Ghost Ship! It appeared!” Many yells came from the crowd. </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to look at the river and black ships started to appear. Some of them were large, and some of them were small. Those that were smaller in size could contain three people at most, and the larger ones could contain up to a hundred! The largest ship on the river could contain tens of thousands of experts! </p>
			<p> The experts on the riverbank soared into the skies as they flew towards the largest ship. </p>
			<p> The larger the ship, the faster it traveled. It allowed the cultivators to reach the other side earlier than the others and gave them more time to look for treasures. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to board the ships. He knew that every time the Yin Ghost River started to flood, there would be several Supreme Ghost King Ships. The speed of those ships was much faster than the ordinary ones! </p>
			<p> Yue Qing, Qi Wei, and the other young masters were similarly waiting for the Supreme Ghost King Ships to arrive.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3670 – Nether Yang King&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the others were waiting, other experts started to arrive along the riverbank. </p>
			<p> “That’s the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Heavenly Blood Ghost King has arrived!” </p>
			<p> “Green Winged Ghost King! Evil Dragon Ghost King!” </p>
			<p> Commotion broke out in the crowd as peerless experts started to arrive one by one. 𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝓷𝓸𝙫𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎</p>
			<p> Wang Yue Hong, the Heavenly Blood Ghost King Wei Guang, the Green Winged Ghost King, and Ao Fangwu, the Evil Dragon Ghost King arrived together! </p>
			<p> The three of them were Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. The three of them controlled countless large cities in the area. </p>
			<p> “Lord Heavenly Blood Ghost King!” </p>
			<p> The experts who hadn’t boarded the ships greeted them when the three of them arrived. Several ancestors who were about to board the ships froze on their spots. </p>
			<p> Yue Hong, Wei Guang, and Ao Fangwu nodded at the crowd.  </p>
			<p> Yue Qing and the other young masters around them went over to greet their fathers. </p>
			<p> “Father! You’re finally here!” Yue Qing grinned at Yue Hong. </p>
			<p> “We ran into some matters along the way. Looks like we came at the right time!” Yue Hong laughed. </p>
			<p> “Father, now that all of you are here, we can board the Supreme Ghost King Ship together!” </p>
			<p> Find the original at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> Yue Hong, Wei Guang, and Ao Fangwu looked at each other and Wei Guang shook his head eventually. “No. Lord Nether Yang King won’t be the only one arriving later. There are several more terrifying figures. I’m afraid that we won’t be able to board the Supreme Ghost King Ship this time!” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing gasped. “Several more terrifying figures?!” </p>
			<p> “Yes. I heard that Wu Zun will be coming too.” Wei Guang said in a solemn tone. </p>
			<p> “Lord Wu Zun?!” Yue Qing and the others exclaimed in fright. </p>
			<p> Wu Zun’s fame in the Green Ghost Lands was legendary! He was an existence who was barely weaker than Lord Nether Yang King! </p>
			<p> “That’s right. Lord Wu Zun is coming! He’s not the only one. Senior Bing Yu will be coming too! Lord Jiu Yu is also part of the group.” Ao Fangwu explained. </p>
			<p> “Senior Bing Yu!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Jiu Yu!” </p>
			<p> The expressions on the faces of Yue Qing and the others changed. </p>
			<p> Even though Senior Bing Yu wasn’t as strong as Wu Zun, his status was exalted! It was said that he was the master of the Yin Reversal Ghost King! Even though it was just a rumor, that proved his seniority! </p>
			<p> As for Lord Jiu Yu, he was Lord Gui Chi’s direct disciple! </p>
			<p> That was Lord Gui Chi they were talking about! </p>
			<p> Without the Green Ghost personally controlling the matters that took place in the Green Ghost Lands, Gui Chi was king! As Gui Chi’s personal disciple, Jiu Yu was considered the son of god! </p>
			<p> Even the ten great ghost kings would dare to slight him! </p>
			<p> “We have to wait for a little while more. We’ll choose a random ghost king ship later.” Yue Hong explained. </p>
			<p> Ordinarily, there would be four Ghost King Ships when the Yin Ghost River was filled! One of them would be the Supreme Ghost King Ship! </p>
			<p> Now that the Nether Yang King and other supreme beings were coming, the Nether Yang King would take one himself! Wu Zun would take another. Bing Yu and Jiu Yu would take the third, and the last one would belong to Yue Hong and the rest. </p>
			<p> Anyone who dared to try to fight to board one of the four ships would be asking for death! </p>
			<p> Yue Qing swept his gaze through the crowd and he saw Huang Xiaolong’s figure staring at the other side of the river. He turned to his father and complained, “Father, there’s one more thing I need to report.” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing spoke about the event that transpired. </p>
			<p> The three ghost kings stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> Since he had his back to them, they couldn’t see his face. </p>
			<p> “What is that kid’s background? Have you found it yet?” Yue Hong asked. </p>
			<p> “No. However, the kid behind him is an eminent elder of a tiny Jiang Family in the Nanfeng City. The old ancestor of their family is a Dao Venerable!” Yue Qing explained. </p>
			<p> “The ship is here!” Ao Fangwu cried all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Everyone turned to look at the river and they saw a massive ship floating towards them. It was large enough to contain millions of people, and the body of the ship looked much sturdier than the other ships! </p>
			<p> It emitted a majestic air. </p>
			<p> Yue Hong muttered, “Since the ship is here, let’s deal with the kid another time. The most important thing is to reach the other side!” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing understood the seriousness of the matter and he nodded his head. Of course, he didn’t forget to shoot a glare towards Huang Xiaolong’s back. “He can thank his lucky stars!” </p>
			<p> The three of them flew through the air and landed on the Ghost King Ship that arrived. Those who wanted to board could only return to the riverbank dejectedly. </p>
			<p> With the three ghost kings working together, even ordinary half-step Universe Gods would have to back down. </p>
			<p> Yue Qing and the young masters flew over to the same ship. </p>
			<p> The Ghost King Ship was extremely fast, and it overtook the rest of the ships instantly. On the ship, Yue Qing didn’t forget to glare at Huang Xiaolong one more time. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng who was hiding behind Huang Xiaolong cowered in fear when he noticed Yue Qing’s gaze. He muttered softly behind Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, that… That’s the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Green Winged Ghost King and Evil Dragon Ghost King are beside him! I didn’t think that they would appear together!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong snorted nonchalantly. “They look alright. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng nearly cried from fright. “Lord, they might not look scary, but the experts who died in their hands number in the billions! Especially the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! No one knows how many supreme bloodlines he devoured!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded casually. </p>
			<p> “Lord, why don’t… Why don’t we board a ship?” Jiang Dacheng asked cautiously. He saw that there were many ships already filled to the brim. Experts were starting to fight over the spots on the ships and miserable cries could be heard echoing through the air.  </p>
			<p> There were several experts who would fall into the river from time to time and become a yin spirit! </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng’s face turned pale when he saw the fate of those who fell into the water. </p>
			<p> “We’ll wait for a little while more.” Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you waiting for the next Ghost King Ship?” </p>
			<p> “No. we’re waiting for the Supreme Ghost King Ship.” </p>
			<p> The Supreme Ghost King Ship would usually appear at the end, and Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t bother boarding any other ships. </p>
			<p> “Supreme… Supreme Ghost King Ship?!” Jiang Dacheng exclaimed in shock. “Lord, the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the other said that there were several other supreme beings coming other than the Nether Yang King!” </p>
			<p> “I know.” </p>
			<p> A commotion broke through in the crowd again. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Nether Yang King is here!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3671 – Scram&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Nether Yang King! </p>
			<p> The three words seemed to contain a terrifying power and the riverbank fell into silence. They stared at the incoming flying ship in a respectful silence. </p>
			<p> Those who were fighting over a spot on the ships returned to the riverbank. Those who returned included those who had already obtained a position on their ships. </p>
			<p> That was how scary the name of the Nether Yang King was! </p>
			<p> Initially, the combination of the three ghost kings was enough to terrify thought around them. However, the appearance of the Nether Yang King eclipsed them instantly. </p>
			<p> The Heavenly Blood Ghost King, Green Winged Ghost King, and the Evil Dragon Ghost King were considered supreme existences who controlled millions of cities. However, they were mere side characters in the face of the Nether Yang King. </p>
			<p> He was the true boss level figure in the Green Ghost Lands! </p>
			<p> A massive ship drifted over from afar, and the body of the flying ship burned a bright red. A group of experts stood at the bow of the ship. There weren't too many of them and the person who stood at the front was a young man clad in crimson and black robes. </p>
			<p> Nether Yang King!  </p>
			<p> He didn’t exude the slightest bit of qi around him. Even so, his presence overshadowed those around him. No matter if they were experts from the Yin Ghost Race, Human Race, or the Ghost Beasts, they got to their knees as soon as the Nether Yang King arrived. Even Jiang Dacheng fell to his knees. </p>
			<p> When the flying ship stopped, the group of experts disembarked. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King took the lead and walked towards the riverbank. </p>
			<p> When he saw one figure standing tall on the riverbank facing away from him, he stopped in his tracks and a frown formed on his face. </p>
			<p> “Master, do you want me to…” A middle-aged man appeared from behind the Nether Yang King and spoke. He wanted to ask if he should kill Huang Xiaolong for the disrespect he was showing. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King looked at Huang Xiaolong suspiciously, and he shook his head. “It’s fine. There’s no need for that right now.” </p>
			<p> At that moment, three more flying ships tore through the air. </p>
			<p> “Lord Wu Zun!” </p>
			<p> Read the most updated version of this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> “Senior Bing Yu!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Jiu Yu!” </p>
			<p> Wu Zun came alone, but there was a huge group of experts behind Bing Yu and Jiu Yu. There were hundreds of them in each group!” </p>
			<p> When they saw that the Nether Yang King had already arrived, the three of them bowed respectfully. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King didn’t put on airs when facing the three of them. He cupped his fists and smiled, “Looks like all of you heard the news!” </p>
			<p> Bing Yu was the master in name of the Yin Reversal Ghost King. He existed since the start of the universe, and he was the Nether Yang King’s senior! </p>
			<p> Bing Yu laughed, “Lord Nether Yang King possesses overwhelming strength. Even if we heard the news, we won’t be able to fight you for it!” 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p> Laughter rang through the air. </p>
			<p> The three of them noticed Huang Xiaolong in succession. </p>
			<p> “Who is that?” Bing Yu frowned. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King shook his head in response.  </p>
			<p> “The brat is pretty gutsy…” Wu Zun chuckled. </p>
			<p> “More like he’s ignorant.” Bing Yu mocked. Turning to one of the female attendants behind him, he yelled, “Throw him into the river.” </p>
			<p> The female expert he spoke to was a God of Creation at the small completion stage. With a respectful bow, she started to walk towards Huang Xiaolong. However, a burst of light filled the air as a massive ship appeared on the river. </p>
			<p> All the black ships were pushed to the side with its appearance. </p>
			<p> Staring at the change, the cultivators along the riverbank gasped in fright. The giant ship was black and gold in color, and the aura it emitted was overwhelming! </p>
			<p> “Supreme Ghost King Ship!” The Nether Yang King and the others yelled in shock. </p>
			<p> “Nether Yang King, please.” Senior Bing Yu gestured. </p>
			<p> However, the Nether Yang King replied respectfully, “Senior Bing Yu, you should take the lead…” </p>
			<p> Bing Yu hesitated for a second and looked at the other two. </p>
			<p> “We don’t mind…” Wu Zun and Jiu Yu smiled. </p>
			<p> “Alright. I shall take the lead and start the ball rolling then!” Bing Yu cupped his fists towards the other three before soaring into the air. </p>
			<p> Before he could arrive, Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air. “Let’s go! Our ride is here.” </p>
			<p> A stream of energy wrapped around Jiang Dacheng and brought him towards the Supreme Ghost King Ship. </p>
			<p> Those who were looking at him gasped in fright. No one would think that an unknown expert would dare to fight for a spot on the Supreme Ghost King Ship without the Nether Yang King’s approval! </p>
			<p> Naturally, the Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu were equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> Jiu Yu shook his head and smiled, “This brat… He’s in trouble now.” </p>
			<p> Bing Yu wasn’t just their senior. He was a supreme expert who had 16 billion units of combat strength! </p>
			<p> Wu Zun chuckled in amusement, “Even I have to show Senior Bing Yu some respect when he goes all out. Hehe, his temper isn’t the best! That brat must be crazy to challenge him!” </p>
			<p> Indeed. Bing Yu’s expression turned gloomy and killing intent filled his eyes the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong flying towards the ship. </p>
			<p> “Get him to f*ck off!” Bing Yu didn’t take action personally. Instead, he ordered a God of Creation at the grand completion stage beside him.  </p>
			<p> A slap flew towards Huang Xiaolong, attempting to send him falling into the water. </p>
			<p> A stream of starlight emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and returned the favor. He sent the God of Creation falling into the water below. </p>
			<p> They failed to react in time as the God of Creation released wretched cries of help. </p>
			<p> When those around them finally realized what had happened, Huang Xiaolong arrived on the Supreme Ghost King Ship. </p>
			<p> Bing Yu and the experts behind him boarded half a second later. </p>
			<p> Staring at his subordinate who fell into the water, Bing Yu growled at Huang Xiaolong, “You’ll die a horrible death!” </p>
			<p> “Scram. If you leave the ship now, I’ll let you live. Otherwise, none of you will be walking away. No one can save you…” Huang Xiaolong’s words and actions had long since caused Jiang Dacheng to fall to the ground in fright. </p>
			<p> Bing Yu chuckled as anger filled his heart. “No one can save me?” He released his aura completely and white colored qi icy qi filled the space above the ship. A punch flew towards Huang Xiaolong suddenly. </p>
			<p> The space around his fist froze as it soared towards Huang Xiaolong’s face. </p>
			<p> Without batting an eyelid, Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand. The moment he did, the Nether Yang King and the others felt as though the river of time had reversed. The universe around them flipped upside down!</p>

			<p> They didn’t mistake it. The universe around them did indeed turn upside down. </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy infinitely close to the 27 billion units mark, he had the power the reverse time, much less do something like that. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s strength had long exceeded their scope of understanding. </p>
			<p> Bing Yu, who failed to keep his footing, felt the boundless heaven and earth qi in the surrounding charging towards him. The universe seemed to want to expunge his presence. </p>
			<p> He tried to struggle and scream while circulating his grand cosmos energy frantically. To his horror, he discovered that his grand cosmos energy was frozen completely! Fear emerged from the depths of his heart. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> He felt his body trembling violently. A frightening power surged into his body and his body shattered from the inside out! </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> He heard the rushing of water in his ears, and the next thing he knew, he felt like he was sinking.  </p>
			<p> Pain shot through his body and he felt like something was biting him. </p>
			<p> Blinking his eyes, he returned to reality. He saw countless yin spirits around him and tried to yell. However, no sound came out of his lips. </p>
			<p> On the riverbank, the Nether Yang King and the rest stared at Bing Yu in horror. </p>

			<p> There were half-step Universe Gods who had fallen into the river, but never since the start of existence was there an expert who broke through the 10 billion units barrier who fell in! </p>
			<p> Especially so for Bing Yu who had crossed the 16 billion units mark! </p>
			<p> When everyone saw the yin spirits gnawing on Bing Yu and his subordinates, a chill filled their bodies. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King felt his emotions fluctuating as he stood at the riverbank. He was clearly considering if he should try to save Bing Yu. The yin spirits were terrifying, but with his strength, it was possible for him to try! </p>
			<p> Wu Zun and Jiu Yu stared on in silence. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned around and ignored the flailing experts in the water and their cries of help. In the blink of an eye, the Supreme Ghost King Ship disappeared into the horizon. </p>
			<p> After they left, the Nether Yang King made his move. He tried to save Bing Yu from the river, but a strong backlash forced him back to shore. </p>
			<p> That was the power contained in the Yin Ghost River! </p>
			<p> No matter who it was, the strength in their body would start to fade once they fell into the river. They wouldn’t be able to pull them back to shore. That was why the Yin Ghost River was so feared! Anyone who tried to save those who fell in would face a terrifying backlash. </p>
			<p> “The three of us joining hands should be able to save him!” The Nether Yang King said to Wu Zun and Jiu Yu. </p>
			<p> The two of them nodded quickly. </p>
			<p> Even though they joined hands, they were forced back by the mysterious strength contained in the river. After expanding a huge effort, they dragged him out of the river after taking on the enormous backlash. They looked at Bing Yu and saw that his body was starting to resemble a wrangled mess. Not a single spot was intact and the wounds were so deep they could see his bones! </p>
			<p> They sucked in a cold breath.  </p>
			<p> With their level of cultivation, they could see that the meridians on Bing Yu’s body had been completely devoured! </p>
			<p> The meridians of an existence at Bing Yu’s level were extremely sturdy. Not even peak-grade creation artifacts could damage them! Now, every single strand was in shambles! </p>
			<p> Did it happen when the brat attacked him earlier? </p>
			<p> “Senior Bing Yu, are you alright?!” Wu Zun asked. His grand cosmos energy poured into Bing Yu’s body and tried to restore his meridians. </p>
			<p> How could it be so easy to restore the meridians of an expert at the level of Bing Yu? </p>
			<p> However, the color returned to Bing Yu’s face with their help. The gaping wounds on his body slowly closed up. </p>
			<p> Once they were bitten by the yin spirits in the river, a mysterious yin spirit energy would spread all around and start to corrode the expert’s body. If Bing Yu failed to expel all the yin spirit energy, he wouldn’t be able to fully recover. </p>
			<p> Crawling to his feet, his face twisted with anger as he stared in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s Supreme Ghost King Ship. </p>
			<p> Killing intent filled his eyes. </p>
			<p> “Senior Bing Yu, we don’t have any information on this guy and he possesses terrifying strength. Let’s leave it at this…” Wu Zun muttered. </p>
			<p> “Brother Wu Zun is right.” The Nether Yang King added. </p>
			<p> Even so, the killing intent in Bing Yu’s eyes didn’t fade. “I understand your concerns. He killed hundreds of my subordinates. If not for the three of you, I might have died in the Yin Ghost River. I must have my revenge!” </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King and the two others exchanged glances and frowned. </p>
			<p> Bing Yu retrieved a transmission symbol. It was a transmission symbol given to him by the Yin Reversal Ghost King, and it could be used three times. It was something the ghost king gave him to thank him for his teachings. Now, it could only be used once more. </p>
			<p> Bing Yu stared at it and hesitated for a second before crushing it. 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p> The three of them raised an eyebrow in shock when they saw what Bing Yu did. </p>
			<p> The Yin Reversal King was the leader of the ghost kings and his strength closed in on the 19 billion units mark.  </p>
			<p> When that happened, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng were resting comfortably on the Supreme Ghost King Ship, fully unaware of what went down. </p>
			<p> With the speed of the ship, they started to catch up to the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the rest. </p>
			<p> As the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the others were standing at the bow of their ship and when they saw the Supreme Ghost King Ship, they sucked in cold breaths. </p>
			<p> “Supreme… Supreme Ghost King Ship!” Yue Qing gasped. </p>
			<p> “Could he be Lord Nether Yang King? Is Lord Nether Yang King here?!” Yue Hong was also stunned. </p>
			<p> “Of course it is! Who else will be able to obtain the Supreme Ghost King Boat? Even if it isn’t Lord Nether Yang King, it would be Senior Bing Yu or Lord Wu Zun! It might even be Lord Jiu Yu!” </p>
			<p> Very quickly, the Supreme Ghost King Ship passed them. </p>
			<p> They saw two figures standing on board the Supreme Ghost King Ship, and Yue Qing yelled in fright, “How?! There’s no way!” </p>
			<p> The faces of Yue Hong and the others were a sight to behold. </p>
			<p> On the Supreme Ghost King Ship, Huang Xiaolong glanced at them as he passed, but in the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the distance.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3673 – Sword Grave&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Long after Huang Xiaolong and the rest disappeared, Yue Hong and the rest were still standing there, dumbfounded. </p>
			<p> “This… Did we see wrong?” Yue Qing cried all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Yue Hong snorted angrily, “Enough! Even if you were mistaken, do you think we’re all blind?” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing looked at his father who was on the verge of exploding and he whispered, “I… I just found it a little incredible!” </p>
			<p> The three ghost kings were curious as well. From what they knew, the Supreme Ghost King Ship should only contain one of the four supreme experts.Why would it be taken by some nameless human? </p>
			<p> “Something definitely happened…” Yue Hong frowned. “I’ll ask the rest of the ghost kings on the shore. Let’s see what they have to say.” He said before taking out the transmission symbol to contact the experts left behind. </p>
			<p> He quickly received a reply. </p>
			<p> When he read the report, Yue Hong felt his mind buzzing. An expression of disbelief formed on his face, and he failed to respond to the Green Winged Ghost King and Evil Dragon Ghost King calling him. </p>
			<p> “Brother Yue, what happened?” Wei Guang used his grand cosmos energy to propel his yell and woke Yue Hong up.  </p>
			<p> Snapping back to reality, he handed over the transmission symbol to the two of them with his hands trembling. </p>
			<p> The two of them raised their eyebrows in unison. </p>
			<p> However, their expressions resembled Yue Hong after they read the report. </p>
			<p> Fear and anxiousness filled their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Father!” Yue Qing cried. </p>
			<p> “Look at what you’ve done!” Yue Hong gave him a slap across the face, causing him to slam into the deck of the ship. </p>
			<p> Yue Qing touched his swollen face and he looked at his father in disbelief. That was the angriest he had ever seen his father! </p>
			<p> Ao Fangwu’s voice trembled at the side, “Who in the world is that young man?! Not even Senior Bing Yu is his match!” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing’s eyes widened in fright. </p>
			<p> He wondered if he heard wrong. From what Ao Fangwu said, the youngster snatched the Supreme Ghost King Ship from Senior Bing Yu! </p>
			<p> “I heard that all of Senior Bing Yu’s subordinates were thrown into the river by the young man. Luckily for him, the Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu worked together to drag him out. He was the only one who survived in the exchange with the young man!” Yue Hong’s face turned as white as a sheet. </p>
			<p> Initially, he planned to get rid of the human. If not for the appearance of the Ghost King Ship, he might have already… </p>
			<p> “Father, what do we do now? Should we… Should we apologize and compensate the young man after reaching the other side? We’ll beg him to spare our lives!” Yue Qing panicked. 𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝒃𝒏𝓸𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝙢</p>
			<p> Yue Hong’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> “No… Things aren’t as bad as they seem. Senior Bing Yu has already contacted Lord Yin Reversal Ghost King. I heard that Lord Yin Reversal is nearby and he’s rushing towards us as we speak. No matter how strong that brat is, he won’t be Lord Yin Reversal’s match!” Ao Fangwu muttered. </p>
			<p> “Unless he’s an existence at the level of Lord Gui Chi…” Wei Guang frowned. “However, it’s impossible for him to be that strong! Existences at that level can be counted on both hands in the entire Unknown Lands…” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> Even though the Supreme Ghost King Ship moved terrifyingly quickly, they needed half a day to arrive on the other side.  </p>
			<p> In the half a day, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the various secret arts he had seen. </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng behaved cautiously at the side. </p>
			<p> “This cultivation technique seems suitable for you. Take a look.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden before handing a manual over. </p>
			<p> Receiving it carefully, Jiang Dacheng gasped in fright, “First Heaven Sword Manual?” </p>
			<p> “This… Is this the sword manual produced by Tian Yi Ghost King?!” </p>
			<p> Tian Yi Ghost King was a supreme expert of the Green Ghost Lands! He was comparable to Wu Zun and could be said to be slightly stronger than Bing Yu! </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. He could see that Jiang Dacheng’s talent in the way of the sword was pretty impressive. The First Heaven Sword Manual was perfect for him. </p>
			<p> The reason he didn’t share Jian Wushuang’s sword manual was because the principle behind it was too profound. Even if he gave it to Jiang Dacheng, he might not be able to comprehend anything. </p>
			<p> “Thank you, Lord!” Jiang Dacheng kowtowed before Huang Xiaolong. He knew that he had chosen to stand on the correct side this time. </p>
			<p> “Get up.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “This is an opportunity for you too.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng kowtowed another time before finally getting to his feet. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong took out several peak-grade grand dao pills and handed them to Jiang Dacheng to assist in his cultivation. </p>
			<p> Half a day later… </p>
			<p> They arrived on the other side of the Yin Ghost River and disembarked. </p>
			<p> The Supreme Ghost King Ship remained in place after they left. One month later, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng would have to return on it before the river started to drain. If that happened, they would be trapped until the river filled up again. </p>
			<p> Once the Yin Ghost River ran dry, the side of the river they were on would fill up with poison mist. It could cause people to lose control of themselves, and even half-step Universe Gods wouldn’t be able to protect themselves! They would turn into a yin spirit after their souls were corrupted. </p>
			<p> As such, anyone who didn’t leave the island before the river ran dry again would face death.  </p>
			<p> “Lord, should we go to the Enlightenment Mountain now?” Jiang Dacheng asked. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to rush. Since we have to cross through the Sword Grave to get there, we can explore the area first.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “The Enlightenment Mountain isn’t too far away.” </p>
			<p> In order to arrive at the Sword Grave, the two of them would need several hours. The Enlightenment Mountain was three days away and the journey there was fraught with dangers! </p>
			<p> They needed to cross through ten different tribulations in order to get there! </p>
			<p> The two of them made their way over to the Sword Grave without the slightest delay. </p>
			<p> Not too long after they left, another Ghost King Ship arrived. The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu disembarked with the rest of their subordinates. </p>
			<p> The three of them wanted to take their own ship, but Huang Xiaolong’s appearance caused them to feel slightly threatened. </p>
			<p> “We don’t know where they went…” Jiu Yu muttered. </p>
			<p> “If Lord Gui Chi came, we wouldn’t be afraid of him!” Wu Zun growled. “Whatever. I’m going to find myself a good sword after going to the Enlightenment Mountain!” </p>
			<p> “It’s along our way… We’ll go to the Sword Grave first.” The Nether Yang King made the decision for them.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3674 – Surprise&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Alright!” Wu Zun laughed, “We’ll go to the Sword Grave now! I heard that the Hell Refining Sword might appear this time!” </p>
			<p> “Hell Refining Sword?!” The Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu gasped in shock. </p>
			<p> The Hell Refining Sword was one of the most famous swords in the Unknown Lands! It was a treasure at the pseudo universe level artifact! </p>
			<p> There were differences between levels of pseudo universe level artifacts. Those born naturally by the universe would be much stronger than those refined by cultivators. </p>
			<p> The moment the Hell Refining Sword was born, the howls of spirits would be heard through the lands. As long as an expert who cultivated in the ghostly arts got their hands on it, they would be able to unleash a terrifying might! </p>
			<p> “Yeah! Other than the Hell Refining Sword, there might be several other pseudo creation level artifacts!” Wu Zun laughed. “This is one of the reasons I came.” </p>
			<p> After hearing the news, the eyes of the Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu lit up. </p>
			<p> “We have to go to the Sword Grave right now! We can’t allow the kid to get all the good stuff!” Jiu Yu chuckled. </p>
			<p> Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng arrived.  </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng was too stunned to speak when he saw the scene at the Sword Grave. </p>
			<p> In front of him, there was an endless amount of swords! There were all types of swords, and there were trillions of them stretching out for as far as he could see! </p>
			<p> It was practically a sea of swords! </p>
			<p> “This… Lord… There are so many swords! How should I find one?” Jiang Dacheng widened his eyes and looked at the sea of swords before him. He didn’t know what he should do. </p>
			<p> Due to the unique properties of the land, all the swords didn’t emit the slightest bit of aura. He couldn’t tell what grade they were! </p>
			<p> “Don’t look at them. Your dao soul and dao eye are useless in this situation. Use your sword heart to find the one that resonates with you!” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng nodded and closed his eyes. He used his sword heart to inspect every sword before him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong did the same. </p>
			<p> There were always rumors about someone obtaining a pseudo universe-level artifact from the Sword Grave. </p>
			<p> With his strength, he wouldn’t care for pseudo universe-level artifacts. However, he was already there. It didn’t hurt to play around a little. </p>
			<p> With his sword heart leading the way, Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of sword qi that started to resonate with him. The stronger the sword qi, the higher quality the sword. </p>
			<p> Swords that had the qualifications to enter the sword grave were definitely of the creation level! Of course, most of them were low-grade creation artifacts. </p>
			<p> The amount of sword qi contained in those swords would be several dozen thousands strands at best. Those of the mid-grade would possess hundreds of thousands of strands. 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s sword heart wasn’t able to spread across a huge distance, but he discovered a sword that contained hundreds of millions of strands of sword qi nearby! </p>
			<p> That had to be an absolute treasure! </p>
			<p> The sword qi contained in the blade was sinister, and one would feel as though they dropped into hell once they came into contact with it! Was that the rumored Hell Refining Sword? He heard about the rumors when discussing the dao with Jian Wushuang in the past. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a second before continuing onwards. </p>
			<p> The Hell Refining Sword was good, but in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, it was slightly better than a toy. </p>
			<p> Just like that, the two of them spent more than an hour in the Sword Grave. </p>
			<p> By that time, the Nether Yang King and the others also arrived. </p>
			<p> When they saw Huang Xiaolong standing quietly in the distance, they heaved a sigh of relief. As long as he hadn’t made his decision, the Hell Refining Sword wouldn’t be taken away! </p>
			<p> The other pseudo universe-level swords were definitely still present. </p>
			<p> “We should start looking for our swords!” Jiu Yu muttered before starting his search. </p>
			<p> “All of you can do the same.” They instructed their subordinates. </p>
			<p> Joy filled their eyes and they started to look around themselves. </p>
			<p> Another hour passed and another group of experts arrived. </p>
			<p> The group consisted of another Ghost King called the Yin Horn Ghost King and his strength was shocking. He might not be as strong as Wu Zun or Jiu Yu, but he was comparable to Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. After they arrived, they started to look for swords that suited them. </p>
			<p> When everyone was searching, a loud yell filled the skies and sword qi shot up into the air. A blood red sword flew out of the Sword Grave and landed in Wu Zun’s hand. </p>
			<p> Wu Zun yelled as an expression of wild joy filled his face. “Hell Refining Sword! It’s the Hell Refining Sword!” </p>
			<p> Another ray of sword light filled the skies and swords appeared in the Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu’s hand. </p>
			<p> Grins broke out on their faces too. “Scarlet Dragon Sword!” </p>
			<p> “Radiant Buddha Sword!” </p>
			<p> The two swords were also pseudo universe level treasures that were born during the creation of the universe!  </p>
			<p> The experts standing around quickly congratulated the three of them. </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> When wide smiles were hanging on their faces, the heavens trembled and something seemed to want to break out from the ground below. </p>
			<p> Under their shocked gazes, the swords in the Sword Grave flew over in a certain direction! </p>
			<p> When that happened, a pillar of light tore into the skies and a sword qi that contained the power to sunder the universe filled the skies. </p>
			<p> “This!” The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu gasped in unison. Comparing the sword qi in their swords to the one that just appeared was like comparing the firefly to the moon. </p>
			<p> How could it be?! The three swords they obtained were pseudo universe-level treasures! How could there be a sword that was a thousand… No! Tens of thousands of times stronger than theirs? </p>
			<p> Could it be?! </p>
			<p> A sword flew into the skies when they were still second guessing themselves. The moment it appeared, the three swords that were obtained earlier fell to the ground and prostrated as though they were subjects before their king! </p>
			<p> Hovering in the air for a second longer, the sword that emerged from the depths of the Sword Grave fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hand. A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He didn’t expect to receive such a huge surprise on his trip.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3675 – Reversal Sword&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu stared at the sword in his hand and gasped in unison, “Reversal Sword!” </p>
			<p> That was the ranked number one sword in the thirteen universes! It was also a universe treasure itself! </p>
			<p> According to the legends, the wielder of the Reversal Sword would gain the ability to control the power of yin and yang! </p>
			<p> The power of yin and yang was contained in every being in the universes. </p>
			<p> The experts currently in the Sword Grave couldn’t believe their eyes. The Reversal Sword had been hiding under their feet the whole time! </p>
			<p> No one would believe them unless they saw how it emerged. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the sword in his hand and lightly caressed the blade. The Reversal Sword was like an obedient child who hummed quietly. </p>
			<p> “Heh, what a playful child.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> He saw the burning gaze in the eyes of those around him and a smile appeared on his face. “What’s the matter, you want to snatch it?”  </p>
			<p> Everyone could hear the mockery in his voice. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu felt their expressions turning grim. That was a universe treasure they were talking about! Everyone would feel tempted to snatch it! </p>
			<p> Moreover, it was also said that anyone who refined the Reversal Sword would be able to comprehend the strongest sword manual in existence! </p>
			<p> To put things into perspective, Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Sword Manual would be worthless beside it! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong saw the looks of hesitation on their faces and chuckled, “If no one wishes to fight me for it, I’ll be heading to the Enlightenment Mountain.” </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng also managed to find his sword when the Reversal Sword emerged earlier. </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King could no longer resist the temptation and he took a step out. Sucking in a cold breath, he said, “I will challenge you.” </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong defeated Bing Yu when they fought over the Supreme Ghost King Ship, the Nether Yang King couldn’t control the greed in his heart when faced with the Reversal Sword. He felt that he stood a chance against Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> After all, Bing Yu only had 16 billion units of combat strength. He had exceeded the 18 billion mark! </p>
			<p> With his current strength, he had the ability to fight most people in the Unknown Lands! Unless Gui Chi or Lord Green Ghost came personally, he would be able to retreat eventually! 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝓌ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “You better think about it carefully. The moment you try anything, you’ll end up like Bing Yu.” </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King’s expression sank in response. “Do you really think you’ve won before we even started? You’re overestimating yourself!” </p>
			<p> “Alright, make your move.” Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to talk to him anymore. </p>
			<p> Raising the Scarlet Dragon Sword he just obtained, he summoned another ghost blade in his other hand. </p>
			<p> The ghost blade was crescent shaped and it emitted a soft blue glow. The cries of countless devils caused goosebumps to appear on everyone’s bodies. </p>
			<p> That was the Nether Yang Ghost Blade the Nether Yang King crafted after gathering countless types of precious resources in the Green Ghost Lands. It was a pseudo universe treasure, and it used the souls of countless starving ghosts as its weapon spirit. The blade would produce a sort of ghastly liquid and it was a type of supreme poison that could dissolve his opponent’s dao soul! </p>
			<p> Even though he revealed his weapon, he didn’t take action immediately. He started to gather his strength and a black sun appeared behind him.  </p>
			<p> As soon as it appeared, it snapped up all the light in the world. </p>
			<p> Turning the world around him into pure darkness, the experts standing around quickly retreated. Not even Wu Zun and Jiu Yu dared to remain. The black light that came from the reverse sun behind the Nether Yang King wasn’t something they dared to take on. </p>
			<p> Everyone who knows about the Nether Yang King would know that he trained in the Nether Sun Manual! He lived in the Black Wind Hell, and he made it according to the principle of the darkness hurricanes there! The rays of darkness contained terrifying streaks of black wind! </p>
			<p> The black wind could corrode the bodies of those it touched. It was formless, and it was extremely terrifying. </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained in his spot and he didn’t bother raising his defenses with his grand cosmos energy. He simply tanked the black wind with his physical body! </p>
			<p> The Nether Yang King sucked in a cold breath when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s reaction to his attack. He didn’t know why, but he felt like retreating all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> When he wanted to try something else, a voice tore through the void. “Brother Nether Yang King grew stronger again!” </p>
			<p> The sudden interruption caused everyone to stare in the direction of the voice. </p>
			<p> A young man emerged from the darkness, and Bing Yu stood beside him! </p>
			<p> The young man looked extremely handsome, but there was an air of evil around him. </p>
			<p> “Yin Reversal Ghost King!” Someone in the crowd yelled and their expressions changed. </p>
			<p> Yin Reversal Ghost King, the leader of the Ghost Kings in the Green Ghost Lands! </p>
			<p> A smile broke out on the Nether Yang King’s face. “Brother Yin Reversal, you’re here! It’s been a long time since we last met.” </p>
			<p> “Yes. It's been long. After we deal with this brat, we’ll have a good drink!” The Yin Reversal King muttered. </p>
			<p> “Of course!” The Nether Yang King grinned in approval. </p>
			<p> As the Yin Reversal King walked towards Huang Xiaolong, he caught sight of the Reversal Sword in his hand. His eyes lit up instantly. “Brother Nether Yang, let’s kill him now.”  </p>
			<p> “That’s exactly my intention.” </p>
			<p> A chilly air surrounded the Yin Reversal King’s body and the temperature in the region seemed to dip by several degrees. Silver light emerged from his body and it seemed to be completely different from the black light from the Nether Yang King. </p>
			<p> Even though their powers were completely different, it melded together perfectly! </p>
			<p> Bing Yu glared at Huang Xiaolong in the distance and he sneered in contempt. Now that the Yin Reversal King and the Nether Yang King were working together, they would be able to make Gui Chi think twice when fighting them! He refused to believe that the kid was stronger than Lord Gui Chi! </p>
			<p> Brat, you’re asking to die! How dare you fight with me for the Supreme Ghost King Ship?! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong muttered softly while looking at the two of them. “Since you’re ready, hurry up and make your move.” </p>
			<p> The two ghost kings soared into the air and a ghost chain appeared in the Yin Reversal Ghost King’s hand. It shot towards Huang Xiaolong and wrapped around his neck instantly. The ghost chain was extremely sharp, and it decapitated many experts in the past before they could react. </p>
			<p> The Ghost Blade in the Nether Yang King’s hand shot out at the same time and it formed a ray of black light that shot towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. </p>
			<p> Wu Zun and the others couldn’t even see the two experts making their moves! They were too fast and all the others could see was a blur! </p>
			<p> Of course, that only applied to experts other than Huang Xiaolong. In his eyes, their weapons came towards him in slow motion. He only waved his sword when the Ghost Chain and Ghost Blade arrived before him.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3676 – Capital City&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The Reversal Sword didn’t emit much light when Huang Xiaolong waved it around. It looked like an ordinary sword that couldn’t be less noteworthy! Even so, the chain and blade clattered to the ground. </p>
			<p> The Ghost Chain shattered into countless pieces, and the Ghost Blade shattered into pieces. </p>
			<p> The two Ghost Kings stood rooted to their spots. The light in their eyes started to dissipate. </p>
			<p> “It’s pretty sharp…” Huang Xiaolong Huang Xiaolong glanced at the sword once before keeping it. He walked away content, and Jiang Dacheng stared at him in fright. However, he kept up with Huang Xiaolong the best he could. </p>
			<p> Everyone stared at the leaving Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. </p>
			<p> Was that it?! Was he leaving just like that? </p>
			<p> As Huang Xiaolong turned around, the bodies of the two ghost kings started to split apart. </p>
			<p> A fountain of blood sprouted from their heads. </p>
			<p> Wu Zun, Jiu Yu, and the others couldn’t believe their eyes.  </p>
			<p> Bing Yu had it the worst as his face turned ashen gray. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong passed Bing Yu, he paused for a second and muttered, “Since they saved you, you should have cherished your chance to live. You shouldn’t have chosen to mess with me again.” Pointing at Bing Yu, a tiny flame entered his chest before incinerating his body. </p>
			<p> When that was going on, Yue Hong and the others were starting to approach on their Ghost King Ship. They might have started their journey earlier than Huang Xiaolong, but their Ghost King Ship was much slower than the Supreme Ghost King Ship! They were even slower than Bing Yu and the rest! </p>
			<p> “I think Lord Yin Reversal and the rest should have arrived…” Yue Hong muttered. </p>
			<p> After all, they saw the Yin Reversal Ghost King and Bing Yu pass them earlier. </p>
			<p> Ao Fangwu nodded slightly. “They might have already clashed. Hahaha, with Lord Yin Reversal’s strength, he would have killed the kid in a second!” </p>
			<p> Yue Hong’s transmission symbol rang and he slowly took it out. From the looks of it, the report came from an eminent elder from the Yin Horn Race. </p>
			<p> Before reading the report, he chuckled in amusement, “It’s from the Yin Horn Race. Looks like the battle is over and the good news is here.” </p>
			<p> The eminent elder from the Yin Horn Race was a great friend of his, and the excitement on the faces of the rest started to show. As they read the report together, their faces started to sink. Explosions rang through their minds. By the time they read the last portion of the report, their souls seemed to have left their bodies. </p>
			<p> Yue Qing and the others started to crowd around them in confusion. </p>
			<p> “What?! Lord Yin Reversal and Lord Nether Yang joined hands… And lost?!” 𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> “Their physical bodies were completely destroyed!” </p>
			<p> Yue Qing and the others felt their legs trembling fiercely. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After leaving the Sword Grave, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng completed the tribulations and arrived at the Enlightenment Mountain. </p>
			<p> “Is this it?” Jiang Dacheng looked at the mountain peak before him and frowned. The Enlightenment Peak in his mind was much more imposing. However, the scene before him was far from his expectations. </p>
			<p> “The Enlightenment Peak is much more complicated than it looks.” Huang Xiaolong reminded when he saw the look on Jiang Dacheng’s face. Jiang Dacheng might not be able to see the intricacies behind the mysterious structure, but Huang Xiaolong could! </p>
			<p> The Enlightenment Peak looked ordinary, but it was made up of countless individual spaces. </p>
			<p> Every single rock that made up the mountain was transformed from one of the grand dao laws! </p>
			<p> It could even be said that the entire mountain was made up of the laws! </p>
			<p> “Let’s go. We’ll find a good spot before the others arrive.” Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards the Enlightenment Mountain. With Jiang Dacheng following closely behind, the two of them soon arrived at the foot of the mountain. </p>
			<p> One could only climb up the mountain step by step. There was no way to fly up directly. There were Gods of Creation who refused to abide by the rules and tried to fly up. In the end, they were destroyed by the restrictions on the mountain. </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong had the Universe Boat, he still chose to ascend the mountain step by step. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng barely took a few steps up before he stopped. He huffed and puffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t climb any higher. That was the fate of those who weren’t strong enough. They could only stay at the foot of the mountain. </p>
			<p> “Lord, I can’t go on. You should keep going. I’ll remain here…” Jiang Dacheng panted. </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong knew that there was no use trying to force things. The grand dao laws at the peak of the mountain were extremely intricate. If he forcefully brought Jiang Dacheng up there, the latter wouldn’t be able to comprehend anything anyway. Instead, he might face a huge backlash. </p>
			<p> Leaving Jiang Dacheng behind, Huang Xiaolong started to ascend the mountain. </p>
			<p> The Enlightenment Mountain might not be towering into the heavens, but climbing step by step would take him several hours. The higher he got, the stronger the pressure became. </p>
			<p> Of course, the pressure was basically negligible for existences at Huang Xiaolong’s level. </p>
			<p> Without stopping, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the peak after three short hours. Standing at the top of the Enlightenment Mountain, Huang Xiaolong looked down, only to see countless worlds beneath his feet! They were worlds created from the grand dao laws! </p>
			<p> Slowly sitting down, Huang Xiaolong started to comprehend the mysteries of the grand dao laws… </p>
			<p> Several days passed, and a mysterious feeling seeped into his mind. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, half a month passed. </p>
			<p> The world under him started to experience a huge change, and it was no longer the pure sheet of white it had once been. </p>
			<p> The grand dao laws seemed to turn sentient in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p> Another five days passed, and Huang Xiaolong was still deep in comprehension. </p>
			<p> The grand dao laws around the Enlightenment Peak continued to transform and they danced about like little fairies in his mind.  </p>
			<p> When three more days had passed, Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and leaped off the mountain. Waking Jiang Dacheng up, they left the Enlightenment Peak. </p>
			<p> The Yin Ghost River would only remain open for a single month. As such, the two of them had to return. </p>
			<p> Since the Supreme Ghost King Ship had been imprinted by their dao souls, no other cultivators could seal it from them. </p>
			<p> A day or two later, the two of them returned to shore. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Would you like to stay with my Jiang Family for a few days before leaving?” Jiang Dacheng asked. He knew that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over to the Fengdu City now that he had explored the Yin Ghost River. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong shook his head casually. “It’s alright.” </p>

			<p> After thinking for a moment, he handed over a token. “Take this. If anyone forces you to reveal my location or messes with you, show them this token. They shouldn’t mess with you after.” </p>
			<p> The news of him receiving the Reversal Sword should have already spread through the lands. There were definitely people who would turn their eyes to Jiang Dacheng who followed him throughout his journey. </p>
			<p> When Jiang Dacheng received the token, he looked at the two words inscribed on it and nearly dropped the token in fright. The words ‘Gui Chi’ were carved intricately onto the token!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3677 – 18 Levels of Hell&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng jumped in fright. How on earth did the man before him obtain Lord Gui Chi’s token?! </p>
			<p> He might not have seen Lord Gui Chi’s token before, but he had heard of it! Looking at the token in his hand, he had a feeling that it had to be the legendary artifact. </p>
			<p> “Alright. It doesn’t matter if you know. Gui Chi is currently my subordinate.” Huang Xiaolong explained. </p>
			<p> “?!” Jiang Dacheng couldn’t believe what he was hearing. </p>
			<p> The news was too damn shocking! </p>
			<p> Wasn’t Lord Gui Chi serving Lord Green Ghost?! How on earth did he become someone else’s subordinate?! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at Jiang Dacheng and he didn’t bother explaining further. Soaring into the air, he disappeared into the horizon. </p>
			<p> Jiang Dacheng stood rooted to his spot, and he only snapped back to reality after some time. In a daze, he returned to the city. </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong had left, he brought out the Universe Boat. As he traveled to the Fengdu City, he took out his transmission symbol and contacted Gui Chi. From Gui Chi’s response, he learned that the entire Unknown Lands had already received news of the Reversal Sword. Even the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death were alerted!  </p>
			<p> Gui Chi mentioned that countless experts were rushing over to the Green Ghost Lands as they spoke. There were several region lords among them, and the most prominent of those were the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death! </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord was leading his dragon army, and the God of Death had also mobilized his great Death God Army! </p>
			<p> A suffocating pressure descended on the Green Ghost Lands. </p>
			<p> However, they needed some time to actually get there. To put things into perspective, even Huang Xiaolong took several years to arrive while traveling on the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> “Dragon Overlord… God of Death…” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath. </p>
			<p> It was great that the two of them had come. Along with Zhu Chen and the other region lords, he would take care of them all at once! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong asked Gui Chi several more questions. Half an hour later, he ended the connection and brought out the Reversal Sword. Sitting on the second layer of restrictions in the Universe Boat, he started to cultivate. </p>
			<p> Since he obtained the Reversal Sword, he hadn’t found a time to truly refine it. </p>
			<p> With his grand cosmos energy close to the 27 billion units mark, refining the Reversal Sword was a piece of cake. Especially with the help of the Star Dragon Divine Tree and Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> When he arrived at the Fengdu City several months later, he had already successfully refined the sword! </p>
			<p> The Fengdu City was the most prosperous city in the Green Ghost Lands! </p>
			<p> Yin spirit qi was everywhere in the city, and practically everyone who lived there was a yin spirit. Humans would only enter the city when they had things to do. After entering, they would leave as soon as their business was conducted. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt a gust of icy qi battering against him before he could even enter the city. He felt goosebumps all over his body when the cold air brushed against him. </p>
			<p> After entering the city, he felt as though he had entered an icy hell. There were extremely few people on the streets, and those who were were floating above the ground! </p>
			<p> It was clear that all of them were yin spirits! </p>
			<p> Humans could leave the city as they pleased after entering, but those yin spirits would never be able to leave! </p>
			<p> “Lord, do you wish to buy some ghost flames?! I have all sorts lying around!” Someone asked Huang Xiaolong not long after he entered the city. </p>
			<p> The ghost flame was something that was only sold in the Fengdu City. It was extremely useful for those cultivating in the ghost arts. </p>
			<p> It was difficult to gather ghost flames, and naturally, the price of it was sky high. </p>
			<p> An ordinary ghost flame the size of a thumb cost hundreds of thousands of dao coins! As for those peak-grade ones, one wouldn’t be able to get them unless they had billions of dao coins! </p>
			<p> “Nope.” Huang Xiaolong paused for a second. “I need spiritual veins. Ghost Soul Spiritual Veins. Do you have any?” </p>
			<p> Ghost Spirit Spiritual Veins were a type of universe-level spiritual vein. They were also only found in the Fengdu City. </p>
			<p> The peddler was visibly stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s question. “Lord, you must be joking. How can I sell something like that? They can only be found in the Xiuluo Chamber of Commerces from time to time!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> The Xiuluo Chamber of Commerce was the largest cooperation in the Green Ghost Lands, and it was the biggest Chamber of Commerce in the Unknown Lands! </p>
			<p> “Lord, if you really wish to look for them, I can keep a lookout. I know a manager in the Xiuluo Chamber of Commerce.” The peddler said all of a sudden and a grin appeared on his face. “But… You know… All this costs money!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled before tossing over a spatial artifact. “Is this enough?” </p>
			<p> When the peddler opened the spatial artifact, he was so shocked he nearly dropped it. The amount of dao coins in there could build several mountain ranges! </p>
			<p> “This… This is too much!” He stammered. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong laughed casually. “You can have everything that is left over. Also, I need you to listen around for something.” </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> The peddler nodded obediently and bowed, “I will report to you the moment I hear of it.” </p>
			<p> “Two million years ago, Zhu Chen came to the Green Ghost Lands. However he disappeared ever since. Do you know where he is?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Lord Zhu Chen?! Of the Zhu Lan Lands?!” He never expected Huang Xiaolong to ask about one of the five overlords. </p>
			<p> “That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong replied. </p>
			<p> Sometimes, peddlers on the street had much more knowledge compared to those large chambers of commerce. After all, they were out there listening to rumors everyday. </p>
			<p> The peddler started to hesitate.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by his reaction. From the looks of it, he might actually know something! He was asking for fun, but who would have thought that he actually hit the jackpot? </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong threw out another spatial artifact. When the peddler caught it, he felt his heart leaping out of his throat. There was a huge amount of grand dao level herbs in there! 𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝙤𝙫𝙚𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p> “Tell me where he is and this will all belong to you.” Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Swallowing a mouthful of saliva, he whispered, “I… I learned about it by accident several years ago. I heard that Lord Zhu Chen went to the eighteenth level of the netherworld!” </p>
			<p> “Eighteenth level of the netherworld?” Huang Xiaolon frowned. </p>
			<p> The netherworld was located right under the Fengdu City! The eighteenth level was the one located right at the bottom, and Huang Xiaolong had no idea why Zhu Chen would go there! </p>
			<p> “I have no idea why he went…” The peddler continued, “As for whether or not he left, I have no clue.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded before leaving. </p>
			<p> “Lord! How do I contact you if I come across news of the Ghost Soul Spiritual Veins?” He yelled hastily when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong tossed a transmission symbol out without turning back as he went towards the northern region of the city. That was exactly where the entrance to the netherworld was!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3678 – Something Happened!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> When he approached the entrance of the Netherworld, the city started to shake violently. </p>
			<p> “What’s going on?” </p>
			<p> Countless experts yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> “It’s the Netherworld! Something happened there! Countless evil spirits are charging out of the entrance!” </p>
			<p> “What?! Wasn't there a formation laid down by Lord Green Ghost at the entrance of every layer? How did they come out?!” </p>
			<p> “Who knows?! The formation probably lost effect or something…” </p>
			<p> Chaos broke out in the city. </p>
			<p> The ghosts residing in the Netherworld were truly ferocious creatures. They were extremely bloodthirsty and vicious, unlike the ghost spirits that lived in the city! The ghost spirits that lived in the city were comparable to the human race! The ferocious ghosts that came from the Netherworld were a whole new level of horror. </p>
			<p> Every single level in the Netherworld was vast and boundless, and the amount of ferocious ghosts contained in each one was uncountable! No one knew how many ferocious ghosts the eighteen levels of Netherworld contained, but legends had it that if every single ferocious ghost was released, they would drown half the Green Ghost Lands!  </p>
			<p> That was a massive region they were talking about! </p>
			<p> Compared to the Limitless Lands Huang Xiaolong found himself in when he entered the Unknown Lands, the Green Ghost Lands was much larger! It was a terrifying idea for half the Green Ghost Lands to be overrun! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned serious. </p>
			<p> He could feel the shocking amount of yin ghost qi surging out of the entrance to the Netherworld and it was like an oppressive cloud that was surrounding the city. </p>
			<p> How many ferocious ghosts had to appear before gathering so much yin ghost qi?! </p>
			<p> It seemed as though the creatures had already emerged in the city! Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so much yin ghost qi in the air. </p>
			<p> Yin ghost qi was different from the yin spirit qi that shrouded the Fengdu City. The effects of the yin spirit qi on the human body wasn’t rough at all. It was the yin ghost qi that had corrosive qualities on both the body and dao soul. </p>
			<p> Weaker cultivators would be affected by the yin ghost qi and experience cultivation deviation, falling into madness. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed and he appeared beside the entrance of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> The entrance to the Netherworld wasn’t large at all. It was several feet wide and several feet tall. Ferocious ghosts poured out of it endlessly and they had a terrifying appearance. All of them had blood-red eyes and they revealed their extended fangs. Just the sight of them caused many cultivators to be repulsed. </p>
			<p> In fact, anyone who saw the scene would feel goosebumps all over their body. </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> The entrance to the Netherworld was naturally guarded by a huge army, but in the face of so many ferocious ghosts, they were quickly overrun. </p>
			<p> Some of the soldiers who were guarding the entrance were swallowed by the ferocious ghost in a single bite. Some of them were torn to shreds and their inners were scattered all around. </p>
			<p> The scene was terrifying to say the least. </p>
			<p> Other than the great army that was guarding the entrance, experts had swarmed over endlessly. They tried to stop the advance of the ferocious ghosts, but it was clear that there were far too few of them to make a significant impact. The ferocious ghosts that escaped ran towards the city, and there were some that fled as far as they could. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned and waved his hand once, summoning a sea of flames. The ferocious ghosts that had left the city blew up in flames and turned into ash instantly. </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t use the Universe Origin Fires, the ordinary flames he summoned were more than enough to take care of those creatures. </p>
			<p> His action shocked the experts trying to hold the ferocious ghosts back. </p>
			<p> Turning to stare at him in shock, they couldn’t believe their eyes. </p>
			<p> One had to know that many of the ferocious ghosts who escaped possessed terrifying strength. That was the reason they managed to leave so quickly! Even though they didn’t possess grand cosmos energy, their strength was probably comparable to a God of Creation at the small completion stage! Even so, they were incinerated with a single gesture from the man who appeared out of nowhere! </p>
			<p> When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong moved again. With a single punch, the space around the area distorted and countless ferocious ghosts fell. </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> The Fengdu City trembled under his strength. </p>
			<p> His attack blasted straight through the entrance to the Netherworld, killing every single creature trying to emerge. </p>
			<p> It didn’t stop there. The energy wave swept into the depths of the first layer of the Netherworld, killing every single ferocious ghost within. It didn’t matter how strong they were! They were turned into a pile of black dust! </p>
			<p> A loud boom eventually came from the depths of the first layer of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> The entrance to the Netherworld remained eerily silent after the single punch from Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The jaws of those resisting the invasion dropped.  </p>
			<p> Wasn’t that attack a little too strong? </p>
			<p> They might not know how many ferocious ghosts he killed with a single punch, but they knew that it was a horrifying number! </p>
			<p> “What are you waiting for?” Huang Xiaolong snorted when he noticed their stunned expressions. </p>
			<p> Snapping back to reality, the experts started to kill whatever leftover ferocious ghosts that were left. 𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> Releasing a heart wrenching roar, the ferocious ghosts who remained leaped towards Huang Xiaolong without caring for their lives! They didn’t even care that there were other cultivators who were attacking them! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong simply pressed down with a single palm and a giant imprint formed in the air. When it slammed downwards, a giant crack formed in the earth. </p>
			<p> Those standing around sucked in another cold breath. One had to know that the region around the entrance to the Netherworld was extremely solid. It was refined specifically to withstand the impact of a massive battle. Not even ordinary half-step Universe Gods could cause a single scratch to the ground. </p>
			<p> Now, Huang Xiaolong created a bottomless ravine with a single slap! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong waved his hand once and countless runes flew through the air and planted themselves on the entrance to the Netherworld. The creatures who threatened to pour out were stopped. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong increased the intensity of the barrier in case anything went wrong.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3679 – Who Touched the Formation?!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> After he increased the strength of the formation he laid down, the trembling around the entrance stopped. </p>
			<p> Everyone around the entrance could see ferocious ghosts piling up around it. They tried their hardest to destroy the formation stopping them from leaving. 𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝒏𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> As there were no ferocious ghosts who escaped from the Netherworld, those who managed to escape death earlier were quickly exterminated by the group of experts surrounding the entrance. </p>
			<p> The commander of the army guarding the entrance went over to Huang Xiaolong and bowed gratefully, “Yin Guan of the Fengdu City thanks the Lord for killing the ferocious ghosts!” </p>
			<p> If the ferocious contained in the Netherworld were to run wild, the consequences were imaginable. It would be an understatement to say that the Green Ghost Lands would fall into utter chaos! </p>
			<p> The experts of the various families who were done killing the ferocious devils came over to greet Huang Xiaolong one after another. </p>
			<p> Yin Guan was a half-step Universe God whose combat strength broke through the 10 billion units mark. The experts standing around also possessed some influence in the area, but none of them dared to breathe loudly when facing Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Do you know what happened in the Netherworld?” Huang Xiaolong asked Yin Guan. </p>
			<p> Shaking his head, Yin Guan sighed. “I am not too sure what happened down there. However, it seems as though the eye of the formation guarding the Netherworld was damaged! Someone might have attacked the formation laid down by Lord Green Ghost!”  </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p> The eye of the formation guarding the Netherworld? </p>
			<p> Who had the ability to do something like that? </p>
			<p> Was Zhu Chen behind this? </p>
			<p> However, he didn’t seem to have a motive to do something like that! </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> If Huang Xiaolong subtracted Zhu Chen from the equation, he had no idea who would possess the ability to affect the formation! </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong was deep in thought, another group of experts arrived. </p>
			<p> Yin Guan spoke to Huang Xiaolong when he saw the party of newcomers. “Our city master is here. Please excuse me while I welcome him.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded nonchalantly. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi, the City Lord of the Fengdu City rushed over as quickly as possible. From their names, it wasn’t hard to deduce that they were from the same family. With his position as the Fengdu City Lord, the Yin Family was naturally a massive power in the Green Ghost Lands. </p>
			<p> Yin Guan approached Yin Qi and reported everything that happened, including Huang Xiaolong’s actions. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock before he slowly went over with Yin Guan following closely behind. </p>
			<p> Arriving before Huang Xiaolong, Yin Guan introduced, “Lord, this is the Fengdu City Lord and the patriarch of the Yin Family, Yin Qi!” </p>
			<p> “Fellow cultivator assisted us in exterminating the ferocious ghosts and sealed off the entrance to the Netherworld. I really thank you for that.” Yin Qi cupped his fists respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He might be the Fengdu City Lord and the patriarch of the Yin Family, but he didn’t dare to put on airs around Huang Xiaolong. He realized that he couldn’t feel the slightest bit of aura coming off Huang Xiaolong. From what Yin Guan said, his strength seemed to be even a level higher than the Yin Reversal King and Nether Yang King! </p>
			<p> “How may I address fellow cultivator?” Yin Qi asked. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong.” </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?” A look of confusion appeared on Yin Qi’s face. </p>
			<p> One of the experts of the Yin Family cried out all of a sudden, “City Lord, the young lady is still trapped in the Netherworld!” </p>
			<p> “What?!” Yin Guan yelled before Yin Qi could even say anything. </p>
			<p> “Did Yin Ping enter the Netherworld?! When did she enter?! Why didn’t I hear about this?!” Yin Qi roared. </p>
			<p> The expert who made the report flinched before spilling everything he knew. “The young lady entered a month ago! Along with the young lady of the Yin Family, they gathered a group of experts before entering the Netherworld to train themselves! The young lady was afraid that you would stop her and she chose not to report her whereabouts. I only learned about this from the patriarch of the Ying Family!” </p>
			<p> A frown appeared on Yin Qi’s face and panic filled his heart. “She went too far this time! Does she think her life is a joke?!” </p>
			<p> He looked at the ferocious ghosts pounding away at Huang Xiaolong’s seal around the entrance of the Netherworld and he gulped. He might have 16 billion units of combat strength, but he knew that he would be overwhelmed the moment he entered! There was no way he would be able to save her. </p>
			<p> “City Lord, we can mobilize the army! We’ll charge in and save the young lady!” Yin Guan muttered. </p>
			<p> However, Yin Qi shook his head slowly. “Even if you gather all the troops stationed in the Fengdu City, you won’t be able to do anything. Everyone who enters now will only be giving up their lives for nothing.” </p>
			<p> “I’ll go.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Yin Family stared at him in shock. </p>
			<p> “Many thanks for fellow cultivator’s kind intentions…” Yin Qi cupped his fists towards Huang Xiaolong, “Fellow cultivator might possess extraordinary strength, but the Netherworld is too dangerous right now! There is no need to throw your life away.” </p>
			<p> He thought that no matter how strong Huang Xiaolong was, he wouldn’t be able to do a thing after entering the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> “What does your daughter look like? I need the descriptions of her friends too.” Huang Xiaolong ignored Yin Qi and continued. He was planning to look for Zhu Chen in the Netherworld anyway. If he ran into them, he didn’t mind saving them. </p>
			<p> Moreover, he wanted to learn the reason behind the damaged formation. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi stared at him in shock for a moment. However, he eventually told Huang Xiaolong what he needed to know. “Fellow Cultivator Huang, the Netherworld is really very dangerous right now…” </p>
			<p> Before he could complete his warning, Huang Xiaolong had already disappeared. A flash appeared on the other side of the seal he created, and he entered the sea of ferocious ghosts.  </p>
			<p> Yin Qi stared at the entrance to the Netherworld in fright. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Perhaps… Perhaps Lord Huang will be able to save the young lady…” Yin Guan muttered. </p>
			<p> “Unless Lord Gui Chi personally descends, there might not be any hope…” Yin Qi sighed. “A more important matter is at hand. Why did the formation stop working? Did any suspicious characters enter the Netherworld in the past few years?” </p>
			<p> Yin Guan thought about it for a second before replying, “There were too many experts who entered the Netherworld. I didn’t notice any suspicious activity going on…” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> After Huang Xiaolong entered the Netherworld, he glanced at the neverending wave of ferocious ghosts charging his way. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t use his universe treasures. Instead, he circulated his grand cosmos energy and a mysterious force surrounded his body. Every creature who came into contact with it died! </p>
			<p> Every layer of the Netherworld was boundless, and ordinary cultivators wouldn’t be able to notice the path to the next layer. However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary cultivator! With his three great dao souls, he knew where he needed to go. He also managed to discover the presence of Yin Ping and the others. </p>
			<p> At that moment, they were surrounded by ferocious ghosts in all directions. They were pushed to the limits as they tried to stay alive. </p>
			<p> From what he knew, there were sixteen of them who entered the Netherworld. Looking at them now, there were four left.</p>

			<p> Yin Ping was huddled close to the other three and their faces were deathly pale. Despair flashed in their eyes when they saw the never ending wave of ferocious ghosts. </p>
			<p> “Yin Ping, are we really going to turn into food for these creatures?!” The young lady of the Ying Family cried. “I don’t want to die! Please!” 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦𝑤𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> “No! We won’t die!” Yin Ping suppressed the fear in her heart. “My father definitely knows that we have entered the Netherworld. They will come in here to save us!” </p>
			<p> Looking at the endless tide of ferocious ghosts, she started to doubt her own words. Was her father really able to save them? </p>
			<p> Even if he managed to charge his way in, they might already have been eaten by the ferocious ghosts! </p>
			<p> When she thought about the gruesome fate that awaited them, goosebumps formed all over her body. </p>
			<p> Their twelve companions who had died in the hands of the ferocious ghosts were torn to shreds before being swallowed by the vile creatures. She could still hear their wretched cries in her ears. </p>
			<p> If not for the fact that the four of them had a protection talisman from their respective fathers, they would have died a long time ago. Of course, at the rate they were going, they wouldn’t be able to hold out for much longer. </p>
			<p> When the protection barrier around them started to fade, a ball of golden light entered their vision.  </p>
			<p> The golden light started to approach them at a frightening speed and wherever it went, the ferocious ghosts would be turned to dust! </p>
			<p> They noticed a figure shrouded in the golden light as he approached. </p>
			<p> It was a handsome young man covered in golden light, and they couldn’t even begin to describe how handsome he was! </p>
			<p> Every action he made contained some sort of charm that caused their hearts to throb. </p>
			<p> “Is he… Is he here to save us?” The young lady of the Ying Family asked with her voice slightly trembling. </p>
			<p> Save… </p>
			<p> Yin Ping suppressed the shock in her hearts and a look of joy appeared on her face. “Yeah! He has to be! My father definitely sent him here to save us! We’re finally saved!” </p>

			<p> The three other young ladies felt relief sweeping through their hearts. They saw hope at the end of the tunnel. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong heard whatever they said even though he was extremely far away, and after taking a single step, he arrived beside them. </p>
			<p> “Did my father send you in here to save us?” Yin Ping asked. </p>
			<p> “Are you Yin Ping?” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother answering the question and asked one of his own instead. </p>
			<p> “Yes, that’s me!” Yin Ping cried. </p>
			<p> The young lady of the Ying Family yelled at the side, “Me too! I’m the young lady of the Ying Family. Please save us!” </p>
			<p> The two other ladies spoke hastily, pleading with Huang Xiaolong to save them. </p>
			<p> At that point, they were completely terrified of the ferocious ghosts. They didn’t wish to remain in the Netherworld for a single second more. </p>
			<p> “Relax. I’ll get you out.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “Follow me.” </p>
			<p> As soon as he spoke, the barrier of light around him expanded several times. It surrounded the four ladies and he brought them towards the exit. </p>
			<p> Wrapped up in the ball of golden light, the four ladies felt a warm current flowing through their bodies. They also saw the ferocious ghosts who entered the radius of the light crumbling to dust! </p>
			<p> Heaving a sigh of relief, they knew that they were finally saved. </p>
			<p> As they followed closely behind him, the four ladies tried to suppress the shock in their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Lord, are you an expert whose combat strength crossed the 10 billion units mark?” One of the ladies asked in a daze. </p>
			<p> “Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Seeing the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the lady felt her heart thumping in her chest. </p>
			<p> As the four of them were located on the first level of the Netherworld, it wouldn’t take long for them to return. </p>
			<p> When they saw the exit, joy filled their hearts. </p>
			<p> “I’ll send you out now. Yin Qi is waiting outside.” Huang Xiaolong said when they were about to arrive. </p>
			<p> Yin Ping gasped in fright, “Lord, are you not leaving with us?” </p>
			<p> “No. I’ll have to enter the Hidden Hell.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and explained. </p>
			<p> “The Hidden Hell?!” The expressions on the faces of the four ladies changed instantly. </p>
			<p> The Hidden Hell was what they called the lowest of the eighteen levels of hell. It was the most terrifying region in the Unknown Lands! </p>
			<p> When they were still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and the ball of golden light that contained the four ladies flew towards the exit. </p>
			<p> As anxiousness filled Yin Qi and Yin Guan’s hearts, they saw a streak of light shooting towards them after it pierced through the seal laid down by Huang Xiaolong. They were extremely relieved when they saw Yin Ping and the others. </p>
			<p> “Yin Ping!” Yin Qi yelled when he noticed his daughter. </p>
			<p> “Father!” </p>
			<p> Yin Guan appeared at the side and asked, “Young Lady, where is the senior who went in to save you?” </p>
			<p> Staring at Yin Guan in confusion, she eventually connected the dots and realized that he was asking about Huang Xiaolong. Pausing for a second, she muttered, “He said… He said that he’s headed for the Hidden Hell.” </p>
			<p> “What?!” The experts in her surroundings jumped in fright. </p>
			<p> “Is he tired of living?! Why would he head towards the Hidden Hell now?” One of the ancestors of a great clan in the Green Ghost Lands sighed at the side. </p>
			<p> “Not even Lord Gui Chi would dare to enter the Hidden Hell at this time… There are so many ferocious ghosts on the loose right now! The Hidden Hell should be experiencing some sort of disaster!” Someone else quipped. </p>
			<p> The two of them were experts whose combat strength had broken through the 10 billion units mark. </p>
			<p> “I wonder which region this supreme expert called Huang Xiaolong came from. I don’t think our Unknown Lands contain a Huang Family…” </p>
			<p> “Well, I wonder what he wishes to do in the Hidden Hell!”  </p>
			<p> The experts of the various families started discussing among themselves. </p>
			<p> Complicated expressions could be seen on the faces of the four ladies. </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When that was happening, Huang Xiaolong was rushing towards the entrance to the second level of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> After he saved the four ladies, there was no need to waste any more time on the first level. He increased his speed and charged towards the entrance of the second level, and even at his current speed, it would take him nearly a month to get there. Each level in the Netherworld was too damn big! </p>
			<p> Getting annoyed with the distance, Huang Xiaolong eventually brought out the Universe Boat. With its speed, he took several days to arrive at the entrance of the second level. </p>
			<p> He did the same for the rest of the levels… </p>
			<p> Two months later, he finally arrived at the eighteenth level of the Netherworld, the Hidden Hell! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong saw ferocious ghosts pouring towards the seventeenth layer where he came from, but his gaze landed on the eye of the formation laid down by the Green Ghost god knew how many years ago. </p>
			<p> “Looks like something really happened to the eye of the formation…” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he muttered to himself.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3681 – Supreme Expert&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong steered the Universe Boat towards the end of the Netherworld and when he closed in on the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, he disembarked and hid the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> He traveled on foot towards the formation, and it didn’t take him long to arrive. </p>
			<p> The Eighteen Hell Grand Formation was made up of eighteen massive pillars that formed a massive circle. The area they covered was millions of miles large, and there was an altar-like structure in the middle. There were all sorts of runes inscribed onto the altar. </p>
			<p> If the Eighteen Hell Dragon Formation were to activate, all eighteen pillars would emit rays of blinding light. They would form a giant light sphere that would fill every part of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> Now, the altar was dim and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see them reacting even a little. Even the Ghost Staff that was personally refined by the Green Ghost was missing! </p>
			<p> The Ghost Staff might not be a universe treasure, but it was close to one. It was created near the start of the universe, and it was nearly as powerful as ordinary universe treasures. The staff was the reason behind the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation’s power to suppress the evil ghosts residing in the depths of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> Now, it was gone! </p>
			<p> Evidently, someone came to take it away. </p>
			<p> However, the staff was personally refined by the Green Ghost. There were countless restrictions on the staff and not even Gui Shi or Jian Wushuang would be able to approach it!  </p>
			<p> Who in the world had the ability to steal the staff?! </p>
			<p> Since the staff was removed, the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation ceased its operation and evil ghosts poured out from the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> No one knew how many trillion evil ghosts there were, and they charged towards Huang Xiaolong in an endless tide. </p>
			<p> Standing where he was, Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy. When he was ready, he approached the altar. When he passed through the pillars, he felt smaller than an ant! Every single pillar was tens of thousands of miles thick! </p>
			<p> He quickly arrived in front of the altar. </p>
			<p> The moment he did, a ray of sword light appeared from the void and slashed down towards him with a speed faster than the eye could see. </p>
			<p> The ray of sword light had the ability to shatter the earth, and it was much stronger than the One Sword Universe Dao Jian Wushuang comprehended! </p>
			<p> When Jian Wushuang displayed his abilities during the ceremony held by the Jian Family, Gui Shi and the White Xuan Old Woman were shocked. Now, the ray of sword light was several times more terrifying than that! One could only imagine how strong it was! </p>
			<p> The moment it appeared, Huang Xiaolong reacted. He twisted his body to dodge the strike. </p>
			<p> The sword light slammed into the altar, causing a deep cut to form on its side. </p>
			<p> In the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, everything was made with universe black steel essence. The entire area was lined with runes made by the Green Ghost himself, and not even Zhu Chen could cause a scratch to the surroundings. Now, the sword light managed to slice a huge chunk out of the land! </p>
			<p> “Huh?” </p>
			<p> The person who unleashed the sword light gasped in shock when he saw how easily Huang Xiaolong dodged. </p>
			<p> Turning to look into the void, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Are you planning on hiding like a wimp?” </p>
			<p> The moment the words left his lips, a figure stepped out from the void. He was a youngster clad in golden robes. Weird light flickered around him and he gave off the aura of a ruler. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted. </p>
			<p> Before entering the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, Huang Xiaolong had already guessed that the person who stole the staff was hiding nearby. However, he didn’t expect to be unable to detect the man! </p>
			<p> He felt a faint sense of danger coming from the golden-robed young man and it had been a long time since Huang Xiaolong felt something like that. </p>
			<p> The golden-robed young man was the strongest person Huang Xiaolong had met till date! </p>
			<p> Even though Huang Xiaolong hadn’t met the Green Ghost, he was absolutely certain that the young man before him was stronger than the Green Ghost! </p>
			<p> In fact, the golden-robed young man was stronger than himself! </p>
			<p> His combat strength had to cross the 27 billion units mark! </p>
			<p> Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong would never feel any sense of danger. </p>
			<p> A name crossed his mind, and it was someone he didn’t wish to meet. </p>
			<p> Ferocious Devil! </p>
			<p> The Ferocious Devil was the strongest person in the Unknown Space, and he was the only one whose combat abilities crossed the 27 billion units mark! </p>
			<p> Even so, Huang Xiaolong denied the possibility. From what Jian Wushuang said, the Ferocious Devil was a middle-aged man who was as buff as could be. The devil qi around his body could be hidden at all. The young man before him didn’t emit a single trace of devil qi! </p>
			<p> “Who might you be?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> Chuckling slightly, the young man replied, “Hey, there’s no need to get nervous. Why don’t you tell me who you are?” 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝓷𝓸𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> Staring down at Huang Xiaolong, he was like a hunter who was looking down on his prey. </p>
			<p> Nervous? </p>
			<p> It was true that his combat abilities had crossed the 27 billion mark. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t nervous at all! </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong?! A look of confusion flashed through his eyes. He felt that anyone who could dodge his sword light would be a well known figure in the Unknown Space. However, that was the first time he was hearing that name. </p>
			<p> From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t lying!  </p>
			<p> “I’m not going to waste time messing about with you. You’re pretty strong so I’ll give you two choices. One, you’ll have to submit to me. Two, I’ll refine you into a Yin God! I’ll give you five minutes to think about it. Before you give me an answer, you better think it through. There’s only one correct choice in this…” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the choices. </p>
			<p> Didn’t he say something along the same lines when he subdued the Limitless Master and the others?! </p>
			<p> “Do you really think that you’ll be able to suppress me?” Huang Xiaolong spoke casually. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on the young man’s face when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s attitude to the situation. “Do you think you can escape now that you’re here?! Let me tell you the truth. I am currently in control of the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation. The moment you entered, you sealed your fate. I was planning to lure the Green Ghost over by stealing his staff, but who would have thought that you would take his place?” </p>
			<p> The Ghost Staff appeared in his hand all of a sudden and he waved it once. The grand formation activated once again as torrents of light trapped Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> It seemed as though the power of the formation became even stronger now that the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation was controlled by him! </p>
			<p> Looking around him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t panic in the slightest. The formation might trap the Green Ghost, but Huang Xiaolong was no Green Ghost. </p>

			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother replying. Instead, he started to circulate his grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> After five minutes, Huang Xiaolong knew that the young man would attack him instantly. </p>
			<p> “Three minutes.” A frosty look slowly formed on the young man’s face when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s lack of reaction. </p>
			<p> “Two…” 𝘧𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> “One minute!” His voice rang in the air and his face turned unfriendly. </p>
			<p> Seconds ticked by and five minutes were nearly up. </p>
			<p> Find the original at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> A short moment before the time was up, Huang Xiaolong sprung into action. A terrifying storm filled the space around him as starlight descended on the lands. 26.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body as the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared. A branch several thousand miles long shot past at the young man clad in gold and sealed off all routes of retreat.  </p>
			<p> A sneer formed on the young man’s lips when Huang Xiaolong moved. He had long since expected Huang Xiaolong to try something when he didn’t surrender immediately. The Ghost Staff in his hand flew out to deflect the branch, but his eyes widened when he noticed what it really was. </p>
			<p> He could feel the terrifying power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the universe source qi around it. Could it be?! </p>
			<p> Without any time to think about it, he pushed himself to his limit in a desperate attempt to stop the strike. </p>
			<p> The power of the staff emerged and countless fierce devils charged at the star dragon that had formed around the branch. </p>
			<p> It was too bad the devils couldn’t even get close to the dragon. With a wave of its body, the star dragon phantom destroyed the devils before flying towards the golden robed young man. </p>
			<p> Grunting, the man revealed the true form of the Ghost Staff that was countless miles tall. Several shadows of the staff appeared behind him to smash at the star dragons that were slowly forming around the branch. </p>
			<p> The Reversal Sword that appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand a while ago turned into a streak of light that appeared before the young man’s chest. As the sword was too quick, it arrived before the man could react. </p>
			<p> Using his grand cosmos energy to protect himself, he tried to stop the Reversal Sword. </p>
			<p> It was too bad it was completely useless. </p>
			<p> His defenses were comparable to a soap bubble that popped the moment the sword arrived. </p>
			<p> Slashing into his chest, it didn’t matter that he was wearing a pseudo universe treasure-level armor. </p>
			<p> The sword emerged from the young man’s back before returning to Huang Xiaolong’s hand. </p>
			<p> Roaring in rage, the man flew backwards to create some distance between them before snorting, “You… That’s the Reversal Sword!” </p>
			<p> He slowly raised his head to look at the giant tree above Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Star Dragon Divine Tree!” </p>
			<p> “Yeah. I bet you didn’t expect to see the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword.” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly. </p>
			<p> It was true. There was no way he would be caught off guard if he knew, but it was too late for regrets.  </p>
			<p> One had to know that his combat strength had reached the 28 billion mark! He was a force to be reckoned with! </p>
			<p> He sneered after seeing the treasures. “I didn’t expect to see so many universe treasures. As it turns out, you’re the one who exterminated the bodies of the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong obtained the Reversal Sword in the Yin Soul River where he exterminated the physical bodies of the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King. The news had already spread through the Unknown Space and many people knew about it. </p>
			<p> “Hehe…” A burning gaze appeared in the young man’s eyes. “Who would have thought that you would be lucky enough to obtain two universe treasures?! Aren’t you aware of the crime of harboring a jade ring?” </p>
			<p> A question came out of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, changing the atmosphere immediately. “Are you even from the Unknown Space?” </p>
			<p> There was only a single existence in the Unknown Space whose combat abilities had crossed the 27 billion mark. Since the young man wasn’t the Fierce Devil, he definitely came from somewhere else. </p>
			<p> Staring at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence for a moment, the young man eventually cackled, “You’re right, I’m not from the Unknown Space.” </p>
			<p> Indeed… </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. If he wasn’t from the Unknown Space, where did he come from? </p>
			<p> He shouldn’t be someone from the Thirteen Universes either. Huang Xiaolong traveled all around the thirteen universes before coming to the Unknown Space. There was no way he wouldn’t know if an expert of the young man’s level was present. </p>
			<p> “You don’t seem to be from the Unknown Space either.” The young man chuckled. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. I come from the Thirteen Universes.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding it. </p>
			<p> “Thirteen Universes?!” The young man was stunned for a solid second. </p>
			<p> He knew exactly how strong the members of the thirteen universes were. All of them were garbage! They didn’t have a supreme expert among them! It was hard to find a single person who crossed the 10 billion grand cosmos energy level, much less someone with 20 billion! </p>
			<p> A sneer soon followed, “Even with the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword, you’re trapped in my Eighteen Hell Grand Formation. If you hand them over, I’ll allow you to leave.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the young man with a mocking smile, “You’ll allow me to leave if I hand them over? Do I look like I was born yesterday? Am I stupid or are you not thinking straight?” </p>
			<p> With his expression sinking slightly, he narrowed his eyes and growled, “I was only injured because you caught me off guard. Do you really think that you can do it again?”  </p>
			<p> “I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over both treasures and I’ll swear in the name of the universe that I’ll allow you to leave.” </p>
			<p> The words barely left his lips when Huang Xiaolong slashed at him once again. A billion light rays appeared and the Star Dragon Divine Tree swept at the young man. </p>
			<p> Jumping back in fright, the young man left the grand formation. He pushed the formation to the limit as weird runes filled the space around Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When the branch of the Star Dragon Divine Tree slammed into the light barrier, it didn’t manage to break through! </p>
			<p> The young man heaved a sigh of relief and he chuckled, “If you really crossed the 27 billion units mark, you might really be able to break through the barrier. It’s too bad you’re not a match for me right now!” </p>
			<p> “Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. With his aura soaring once again, waves of star dragon qi filled the grand formation. At the same time, the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand. </p>
			<p> “Three Gods Halberd!” The golden robed young man was completely dumbfounded. </p>
			<p> With the Reversal Sword in his left hand and the Three Gods Halberd in his right hand, he slashed at the barrier. At the same time, he fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree and sent countless branches into the barrier. </p>
			<p> A massive blast resounded through the skies. </p>
			<p> The formation stopped operating all of a sudden.</p>

				<p>&lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3683 – Who Won?&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
			</title>
			<p>The golden-robed young man jumped in fright.</p>
			<p>He didn’t expert Huang Xiaolong to possess the third ranked universe treasure, the Three Gods Halberd!</p>
			<p>The Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword might not be able to destroy the formation, but the addition of the Three Gods Halberd was more than enough to overpower it!</p>
			<p>He was planning to reactivate the formation once again when countless branches gathered together before shooting outwards. The light barrier created by the formation was shattered in an instant.</p>
			<p>The young man couldn’t reform the barrier in time.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong turned into a streak of light and charged out of the formation. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd in his hand didn’t remain idle as they turned into streaks of light that tore through the void towards the young man.</p>
			<p>Waving his hands desperately, two giant golden hoops appeared to smash into the two weapons.</p>
			<p>The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd returned to Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and the hoops returned to the young man. It might look like a draw, but there were visible marks on the young man’s golden hoops.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s form in the Star Dragon Divine Tree continued his assault on the golden robed man. </p>
			<p>He retreated once again and a giant golden cloth appeared in his hand without warning. Tossing it out, it expanded to cover the entire sky above them! A rain of golden light emerged and fell on the lands.</p>
			<p>That was right! It was raining golden light!</p>
			<p>Countless rays beamed down on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Staring at the incoming attack, Huang Xiaolong turned serious. He could see that the golden light contained extraordinary power and it was countess times stronger than the power of gold!</p>
			<p>It contained a shocking corrosive power and it was of an extremely poisonous nature.</p>
			<p>It was at a level Huang Xiaolong hadn’t seen before!</p>
			<p>Hastily using the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, star dragon qi filled the skies. Giant branches appeared to shield the main body, blocking off the golden rain.</p>
			<p>Black smoke rose from the surface of the Star Dragon Divine Tree.</p>
			<p>The sturdy universe treasure became riddled with holes!</p>
			<p>One could only imagine how terrifying the golden rain was.</p>
			<p>After so many years of battle, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t met anyone who could scratch the Star Dragon Divine Tree, much less cause holes in them.</p>
			<p>The golden rain wasn’t slowing down as they continued to pelt down on Huang Xioalong.</p>
			<p>Tiny black holes continued to form on the tree.</p>
			<p>Of course, the tiny holes would quickly close up with Huang Xiaolong’s constant injection of grand cosmos energy. It was impossible for the young man to injure Huang Xiaolong with his golden rain.</p>
			<p>Not stopping there, Huang Xiaolong’s body flickered and the weapons in his hand shot towards the golden robed young man.</p>
			<p>Destructive energy swept through the Netherworld.</p>
			<p>The trillions upon trillions of evil devils that resided in the area failed to escape from the world-ending shockwave coming from the battle between the two supreme experts and they were vaporized completely. </p>
			<p>As the battle raged on, the seventeenth level of the Netherworld was affected. The battle soon spread to the sixteenth and seventeenth level…</p>
			<p>Yin Qi and Yin Guan who were waiting outside the first level felt the trembling coming from the Netherworld as they were discussing how they should deal with the matter of the evil ghosts.</p>
			<p>They stared at each other in shock.</p>
			<p>“What’s going on?!”</p>
			<p>“It seems to be coming from the eighteenth level!” </p>
			<p>“There’s a battle going on! I wonder who are the ones fighting… How can the battle spread up all eighteen levels?!”</p>
			<p>Yin Qi and Yin Guan gasped in fright, along with the experts of the various families.</p>
			<p>“City Lord, do you think Lord Huang…” Yin Guan spoke all of a sudden. Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed through his mind the moment he felt the trembling.</p>
			<p>Yin Qi raised an eyebrow in fright. However, he quickly shook his head. “I don’t think so. He might be stronger than me, but he isn’t that much stronger!” </p>
			<p>The two energies that came from the eighteenth level of the Netherworld was far too terrifying!</p>
			<p>In Yin Qi’s mind, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could possess such power!</p>
			<p>While they were guessing the identities of the fighters, the ground shook once.</p>
			<p>A frightening amount of power burst out from under the ground as it covered the city. Even with seventeen levels of the Netherworld between them, Yin Qi and the others felt suffocated.</p>
			<p>The experts standing around felt their legs going soft.𝙛𝙧𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>The shocking thing was that the energy coming from the ground was growing stronger as time passed!</p>
			<p>Finally, they were unable to bear the shockwaves coming from the ground and everyone started to escape from the city. When they finally left, the suffocating feeling receded.</p>
			<p>“It’s too terrifying! The battle has to be between experts who crossed the 20 billion mark!” </p>
			<p>“Who in the world are they?! Did Lord Zhu Chen start a battle with someone? DIdn’t Lord Zhu Chen enter the eighteenth level two million yeras ago? He hasn’t returned since then…”</p>
			<p>“Who is the other guy?! Is Lord Green Ghost down there too? Or could it be the God of Death or the Dragon Overlord?”</p>
			<p>Everyone started to guess.</p>
			<p>Whatever the case, the shockwaves of the battle expanded once again and they were forced to retreat even further.</p>
			<p>Finally, they retreated hundreds of millions of miles away from the city.</p>
			<p>Half a day later…</p>
			<p>The energy that came from the ground disappeared. </p>
			<p>Everyone turned to look at each other with confusion in their eyes.</p>
			<p>“Did it stop?!”</p>
			<p>“I wonder who won…” </p>
			<p>Another half a day passed without any changes in the situation and the experts eventually returned to the city.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>On the eighteenth level, Huang Xiaolong held a piece of golden cloth in his hands. It was sliced off by his Reversal Sword.</p>
			<p>Initially, Huang Xiaolong managed to fight the man to a draw with the three universe treasures. However, as time went by, the limitless recovery power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree allowed Huang Xiaolong to gain the upper hand. In the end, the golden-robed young man decided to escape.</p>
			<p>When he was running away, Huang Xiaolong managed to make a clean strike with the Reversal Sword.</p>
			<p>Of course, he didn’t choose to chase the man. With his current strength, he wouldn’t be able to restrain the young man even with the Universe Boat. There was no need to reveal the strongest universe treasure when it would be of no help to himself.</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat was Huang Xiaolong’s trump card. He would use it in the future when he was sure of taking the golden-robed young man down!</p>
			<p>Looking at the golden cloth in his hand, Huang Xiaolong eventually kept it away. When he meet Zhu Chen, the Green Ghost, or some other supreme overlords, he might be able to gain some information on it.</p>
			<p>A weird burst of energy filled the eighteenth level of the Netherworld all of a sudden, and Huang Xiaolong turned to look in its direction. </p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3684 – Arrival of the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly rushed over only to discover that the fluctuations had disappeared. </p>
			<p> A frown formed on his face as he released his dao souls to look for any traces of the disturbance. </p>
			<p> Could he be mistaken? However, several minutes later, the disturbance came again. This time, it was much stronger than before! </p>
			<p> A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he stared at the Naihe Bridge filled with Blood Maggots. </p>
			<p> Shrill cries came from every part of the bridge, and it was extremely unnerving. There were cries of ghosts accompanied by creepy laughter of children. </p>
			<p> Slowly approaching the bridge, Huang Xiaolong thought about the stories he heard from Jian Wushuang and Gui Chi. He knew that one wouldn’t be able to leave the bridge the moment they stepped foot on it. </p>
			<p> Sucking in a long breath, Huang Xiaolong took the first step onto the Naihe Bridge. </p>
			<p> Even though it was a forbidden zone for many, Huang Xiaolong had a multitude of universe treasures. With the Universe Boat as his trump card, he was confident that he could emerge unscathed. </p>
			<p> When his foot landed on the bridge, a massive wave of blood qi charged towards him.  </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might not be afraid, but he didn’t dare to be careless either. He summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree to create the star dragon world. As they formed a protective region one hundred meters around him, nothing could harm him. The blood maggots might possess terrifying corrosive power, but they couldn’t compare to the golden rain summoned by the young man previously. </p>
			<p> No matter how strong the blood maggots were, they couldn’t do a thing to the star dragon world! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls and he discovered that they were suppressed by a special type of power coming from the bridge. Despite his powerful dao souls, he could only notice the situation ten thousand miles around himself. </p>
			<p> Moreover, his dao souls used an insane amount of energy whenever he tried to scan his surroundings. </p>
			<p> As he continued forward, Huang Xiaolong looked at his surroundings carefully. </p>
			<p> The Blood Maggots weren’t the only creatures he needed to be aware of. There were countless other monsters residing on the bridge, and one of the scariest beasts in the Unknown Space was said to live on the bridge itself! </p>
			<p> Not too long after Huang Xiaolong ventured onto the bridge, a ray of green light shot towards him. The green light was shockingly fast and it seemed to ignore the defensive star dragon world around Huang Xiaolong! It arrived beside Huang Xiaolong’s neck as the creature within chomped down! </p>
			<p> It was too bad Huang Xiaolong had been prepared for any unexpected strikes. </p>
			<p> The Reversal Sword in his hand swept outwards to slice the creature in two. </p>
			<p> When it landed on the floor, Huang Xiaolong discovered that it was a weird monster with two massive fangs and creepy red eyes. It was the size of a fist, and there wasn’t much face to speak of. </p>
			<p> The freak was called the Poison Teeth Blood Monster. </p>
			<p> It possessed much stronger abilities than the Blood Maggots and if it managed to bite someone, they would suck out their victim’s blood essence! </p>
			<p> The creature was covered in a ball of green light that made them extremely hard to kill. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was lucky to possess the Reversal Sword. Otherwise, he might have to waste a little effort if he wished to kill the Poison Teeth Blood Monster. </p>
			<p> After killing it, Huang Xiaolong continued onwards. </p>
			<p> Not too long later, another weird creature attacked Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The creature was silent and it was similar in color to the Blood Maggots. Even if one used their dao souls, they wouldn’t be able to discover it easily. When it arrived behind Huang Xiaolong, it expanded by many times before coiling around the man. However, Huang Xiaolong chopped it up into a thousand pieces with a swing of his Reversal Sword. </p>
			<p> The creature was something similar to a squid. Due to its color, it was called the Blood Tentacle Monster. It could control one’s body and dao soul after latching onto its victim! </p>
			<p> When it controlled its victim completely, it would become the new owner of the body! </p>
			<p> The expert who was controlled would no longer be themselves. </p>
			<p> As such, no one would dare to mess with the Blood Tentacle Monster. </p>
			<p> Half a year passed in an instant. </p>
			<p> In the time that passed, Huang Xiaolong killed an uncountable number of weird creatures. 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝓷𝓸𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong approached the source of the disturbance. </p>
			<p> By then, the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and several other masters of their regions arrived in the Green Ghost Land as they rushed towards the Fengdu City. </p>
			<p> There was an army of dragons following behind the Dragon Overlord, but there were only several dozen thousands of them. </p>
			<p> The Death God Army followed behind the God of Death and they were similar in numbers. </p>
			<p> The masters of the other regions brought along their strongest subordinates as they made their way over to the city. </p>
			<p> More than half the Gods of Creation in the Unknown Space gathered in the Fengdu City and they had one goal and one goal only. They wanted the Reversal Sword! </p>
			<p> The God of Death looked at the Dragon Overlord and he snorted, “Old dragon, you obtained the Yin Yang Fire Wheel. You should be more than content with what you have. Why are you here?! Go away!” </p>
			<p> When the Dragon Overlord stole the map of the universe treasure from the Limitless Master, he managed to locate the treasure and refine it before anyone else got to him. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord roared with laughter and he continued, “You have the Blade of Death too. Since you’re here for the Reversal Sword, why can’t I look for it too?!” </p>
			<p> Blade of Death! </p>
			<p> That was also one of the thirteen universe treasures. </p>
			<p> Actually, all five supreme overlords had a universe treasure each. </p>
			<p> The God of Death snorted slightly and he didn’t continue to bicker with the Dragon Overlord.  </p>
			<p> “According to Yin Qi, Huang Xiaolong is currently in the eighteenth level of the Netherworld. Zhu Chen is down there too.” The Dragon Overlord changed the topic and continued, “Don’t tell me the kid has the same goal as Zhu Chen…” </p>
			<p> The God of Death shook his head and sighed, “Huang Xiaolong’s goal might be Zhu Chen himself…” </p>
			<p> “Huh?!” The Dragon Overlord stared at the God of Death in shock. </p>
			<p> However, the God of Death’s attention was no longer on the dragon. He looked at the entrance of the Netherworld that was covered with several layers of restrictions. “From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong is probably as strong as me.” </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord snorted in contempt. “It’s just several restrictions. They can’t stop me!” After he spoke, he sent a punch flying towards the entrance. Like what happened previously when Huang Xiaolong came, the evil devils near the entrance were exterminated with a single hit. The punch only stopped when it went deep into the first level of the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> “Kill your way in. Even if you have to flip the Netherworld over, find him!” The Dragon Overlord waved his hand and ordered the army behind him to advance. </p>
			<p> He stepped into the entrance and the army followed close behind. </p>
			<p> The God of Death waved his hand and gave the same order. </p>
			<p> When the two of them entered, the masters of their various regions entered with their subordinates. </p>
			<p> The experts of the Unknown Space flooded the Netherworld. No matter how many evil devils there were, they couldn’t stop the supreme overlords advancement.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3685: Finding Zhu Chen</p>
			</title>
			<p>There might be an endless number of evil devils, but they were up against the strongest power in the Unknown Space! The experts who arrived basically represented the apex of strength in the Unknown Space. No matter how many evil devils arrived, they were wiped out in the blink of an eye!</p>
			<p>Naturally, there was no way they could advance faster than Huang Xiaolong when he came in previously. Huang Xiaolong charged in with the Universe Boat previously and his speed alone outclassed any one of them there! With their speed, the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death would need a year or two in order to arrive on the second level.</p>
			<p>Half a year passed…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong arrived at the source of the disturbance on the Naihe Bridge.</p>
			<p>When he saw what was there, he sucked in a cold breath.</p>
			<p>There were countless Blood Tentacle Monsters and Poison Teeth Blood Monsters gathered together, and there were many other weird freaky creatures. There was an endless amount of them and they were comparable to the tide of evil devils outside.</p>
			<p>These creatures were much stronger than evil devils and they were many times harder to kill!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong even noticed several giant creatures among them!</p>
			<p>There was a Blood Tentacle Monster that was the size of a super mountain range standing in the middle of the cluster!  </p>
			<p>The Blood Tentacle Monsters that Huang Xiaolong met in the past were barely half a human tall. The one before him was millions of feet tall!</p>
			<p>It was definitely a terrifying existence to say the least.</p>
			<p>Of course, since there was a massive Blood Tentacle Monster, there had to be a similarly massive Poison Teeth Blood Monster. </p>
			<p>Even if Huang Xiaolong used his butt to think, he would know that the two of them were the kings of the two creatures!</p>
			<p>Every single creature on the Naihe Bridge had their own kings. The kings were the first creatures born when the Netherworld was created, and they were the most ancient of existences.</p>
			<p>When the Green Ghost entered the Naihe Bridge in the past, even he was forced to retreat when he met them!</p>
			<p>The creatures were far too strong. Their defensive and offensive capabilities far exceeded the Green Ghost’s expectations. If the eighteenth level of the Netherworld existed, they would never die!</p>
			<p>Other than the two, there were the Black Locust King, Yin Yan King, and Golden Centipede King.</p>
			<p>The five of them surrounded a youngster that Huang Xiaolong had never seen before.</p>
			<p>Even though that was the case, Huang Xiaolong quickly recognized the man as the old ancestor of the Zhu Family, Zhu Chen!</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen tried to break free from the encirclement, but no matter how hard he tried, he would be forced back into the circle.</p>
			<p>The disturbance came from the battle between Zhu Chen and the five monsters!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could see that it was the end of the line for Zhu Chen. With the strength of the five kings, Zhu Chen would never be able to escape. If he didn’t help the man, it was a matter of time before Zhu Chen turned into monster food.</p>
			<p>“Golden Sun Circlet!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong recognized the item at once. It was one of the thirteen universe treasures!</p>
			<p>When they noticed Huang Xiaolong’s arrival, they were shocked. </p>
			<p>Zhu Chen noticed the Star Dragon Divine Tree that Huang Xiaolong transformed into and a burning gaze appeared on his face. “Star Dragon Divine Tree!”  </p>
			<p>The five kings revealed similar expressions.</p>
			<p>However, the greed in Zhu Chen’s face soon disappeared and he called out to Huang Xiaolong in excitement, “Fellow cultivator, please assist me! When we get out of here, I, Zhu Chen, will express my sincere gratitude!” </p>
			<p>He knew that Huang Xiaolong had to be a powerful cultivator now that he made it all the way over to the end of the Naihe Bridge. With the Star Dragon Divine Tree, he felt that it was very possible for him to finally escape from the five monster kings!</p>
			<p>“I can save you. But I want the Golden Sun Circlet!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen was shocked, but he soon roared in anger, “Are you crazy?!”</p>
			<p>“If I refuse to do anything, do you think you will get the chance to emerge from the Netherworld? You’ll be turning into their food. When that happens, your treasure will end up with me.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong wasn’t trying to scare Zhu Chen. It was true that he would die without Huang Xiaolong’s help. Next, he would deal with the five monster kings to retrieve the treasure.</p>
			<p>With his expression sinking, Zhu Chen sneered, “Even if I die in their hands, do you think you can live?! Are you capable of escaping from all five of them?! You’ll be following me in death!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders and laughed, “Why would I need to escape?”</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen was dumbfounded. </p>
			<p>It was true. Huang Xiaolong never planned on escaping from the five of them. They would make excellent subordinates, and if Huang Xiaolong had to make a choice between the monster kings and Zhu Chen, he would choose them in a heartbeat.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen couldn’t help but frown in confusion when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>Could the brat be planning to…</p>
			<p>A terrifying thought flashed through his mind.</p>
			<p>When he was still stuck in a state of confusion, Huang Xiaolong moved. His figure flashed and he appeared before the five monster kings. The Three Gods Halberd in his hand flew out along with the Reversal Sword. Terrifying waves of energy filled the space the weapons crossed.</p>
			<p>Even though there wasn’t a proper sea in the Netherworld, there was an ocean of blood. The Three Gods Halberd had the ability to control any liquid, and it was easy to gain control of the blood ocean.</p>
			<p>The Reversal Sword behaved the same. Countless monsters were sliced in half. The sword didn’t stop there as it flew towards the five kings. </p>
			<p>Ignoring Zhu Chen completely, they started their assault on Huang Xiaolong. However, Huang Xiaolong was close to the 27 billion units mark and he was leagues ahead of Zhu Chen. With the Three Gods Halberd in hand, he sent all five of them flying at once.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen stared at him in shock.</p>
			<p>Even if the Green Ghost came, he wouldn’t be able to do what Huang Xiaolong did!</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen didn’t expect the youngster before him to be so damn strong! </p>
			<p>He sneakily moved to the side as the battle raged on.</p>
			<p>It was too bad Huang Xiaolong had his sights on Zhu Chen long before he engaged the five monster kings. A ray of sword light emerged and flew towards Zhu Chen without any warning. In a state of desperation, Zhu Chen raised the Golden Sun Circlets in his hand to block the strike.𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝒏𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>A blast ensued as rays of light filled the space around them.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen felt a sharp pain shooting up his arms and he retreated in haste.</p>
			<p>“You!” He glared at Huang Xiaolong with rage as he didn’t expect the man to move against him.</p>
			<p>“Hand it over.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to waste his time with Zhu Chen. After all, he knew what Zhu Chen was planning. He definitely wanted to escape when Huang Xiaolong was busy dealing with the five kings.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3686 – Subduing the Five Kings&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Zhu Chen snorted coldly, “Dream on!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed once again and Zhu Chen became the target of the Three Gods Halberd. The Three Gods Halberd was no Reversal Sword! When it slammed into the Golden Sun Circlet, Zhu Chen lost feeling in his arms. The universe treasure was sent flying into the air as Zhu Chen spat out mouthfuls of blood. </p>
			<p> A terrifying wave of energy appeared behind Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden. The five monster kings were back, and they weren’t planning on giving Huang Xiaolong a good time. They attacked him in unison and Huang Xiaolong no longer held back. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd turned to sweep towards the five monster kings and Huang Xiaolong summoned the four Universe Origin Fires to protect himself. </p>
			<p> As soon as the origin fires appeared, the four fires’ spirits charged out as flames covered god knew how many miles around him. The entire space was turned into a sea of flames. </p>
			<p> The five monster kings were able to defend themselves, but the tiny monsters weren’t so lucky. They were charred beyond belief by the sea of flames. </p>
			<p> The four Universe Origin Fires were the source of all fire in the universe. It was the best counter to anything related to the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong managed to burn off all the poison around him. </p>
			<p> Even though the five monster kings were existences who lived since the creation of the Netherworld, they had to retreat in the face of the four Universe Origin Fires. </p>
			<p> If they were only facing one of the fires, the five monster kings might not be afraid at all. However, all four of them appeared at once and even if the five monster kings were two times as strong as they were, they wouldn’t be able to suppress the combination of the fires.  </p>
			<p> “Universe Origin Fires!” Zhu Chen yelled. </p>
			<p> First there was the Star Dragon Divine Tree. </p>
			<p> Then, the kid summoned the Reversal Sword and the Three Gods Halberd! </p>
			<p> Now, he revealed the existence of the four Universe Origin Fires! </p>
			<p> How in the world did someone gather four universe treasures?! </p>
			<p> What kind of dog-sh*t luck did one have to have in order to obtain so many universe treasures?! </p>
			<p> The five monster kings stared at each other in an attempt to communicate among themselves. </p>
			<p> Soon after, they turned around to flee without any hesitation. </p>
			<p> Since the Netherworld came into existence along with the universe, the five monster kings were more than experienced. They could see that Huang Xiaolong was no Zhu Chen! They had no chance of winning against him! As such, they decided to back off. </p>
			<p> It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t allow any of them to get away. He made his preparations the moment he summoned the flames. </p>
			<p> Starlight fell from the void and it transformed the space around them. An endless amount of star dragon qi filled the area. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Divine Tree branches extended out at a speed faster than anything the monster kings could imagine and they quickly caught up. </p>
			<p> The four origin fires also managed to catch up with the fleeing monster kings before long. </p>
			<p> With the combination of the Universe Origin Fires and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, they were forced back towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree started to extend in all directions, cutting off the space from the outside world. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen jumped in fright as he discovered that the seal trapped him in place too! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with Zhu Chen at the moment and he made his way over to the five monster kings. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen was barely able to threaten him. </p>
			<p> As such, he decided to deal with the five monster kings before anything else. </p>
			<p> With the Star Dragon Divine Tree separating them from the outside world, Zhu Chen couldn’t escape even if he wanted to! </p>
			<p> Soon, the battle between one man and five monster kings began. </p>
			<p> Heaven shattering blasts rang through the space. </p>
			<p> In the star dragon world that was created, not a single creature was left other than the five monster kings and the two humans. </p>
			<p> As the battle raged on, even Zhu Chen didn’t dare to approach. He hid in one of the furthest corners of the star dragon world. </p>
			<p> Despair filled his heart when he saw how Huang Xiaolong was suppressing all five monster kings. </p>
			<p> The fear in his eyes grew stronger and stronger as time passed. </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> He tried his hardest to shatter the barrier created by the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but with his strength, he wasn’t even close to causing a scratch in the barrier! </p>
			<p> Even with his Golden Sun Circlet, he couldn’t do a thing! </p>
			<p> The Golden Sun Circlet might possess strong defensive abilities, but there was no way they were as strong as the Reversal Sword and the Three Gods Halberd! </p>
			<p> The battle had the ability to shatter the heavens and split the earth. The space within the star dragon world was a mess and as the battle raged on, Zhu Chen could only use his Golden Sun Circlets to prevent himself from getting injured by the shockwaves. </p>
			<p> No matter how strong it was, it failed to stop the impact completely. </p>
			<p> Every time a blast rang through the skies, his heart would jump as he got ready to receive the incoming strike. </p>
			<p> The battle raged on for one entire day. </p>
			<p> After the day had passed, Huang Xiaolong finally subdued all five monster kings. </p>
			<p> As they prostrated before him, they became five cute creatures that no longer possessed any threat to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> When he saw the look in their eyes, he felt a weird feeling running through his body.  </p>
			<p> It was truly a weird feeling for five ferocious beasts to look at him that way. </p>
			<p> After subduing them, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards Zhu Chen. </p>
			<p> When he arrived, Zhu Chen had sealed himself in the defensive barrier created by his universe treasure. </p>
			<p> “What… What do you want from me?!” </p>
			<p> Even when he faced the Green Ghost, he wasn’t as afraid as he was now! </p>
			<p> “You know what I want.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You saw what happened to the five of them. I’ll give you three minutes to consider your fate.” 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p> Zhu Chen’s expression flickered uncontrollably. </p>
			<p> Eventually, he fell to his knees as he submitted to Huang Xiaolong. He handed over his Golden Sun Circlet. </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, there was no way he could escape! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong retrieved the treasure and sighed.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3687 – Universe First Race&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The circlet emitted warmth in his hands as it soothed his soul. </p>
			<p> Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong thought about all the universe treasures he gathered. There was the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Three Gods Halberd, Reversal Sword, the four Universe Origin Fires, and the Golden Sun Circlet! He had six of them in total! </p>
			<p> Legends had it that one would possess unimaginable power if they managed to gather all thirteen universe treasures! </p>
			<p> Of course, that was nothing more than a rumor. </p>
			<p> Still, Huang Xiaolong felt that he should at least try to gather all thirteen of them! </p>
			<p> Even though no one had been able to gather all thirteen universe treasures since the ancient times, someone might be able to eventually! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong made Zhu Chen release his defenses before branding his soul. </p>
			<p> Soon after, he asked Zhu Chen about the reason behind his entry to the Naihe Bridge. </p>
			<p> “I received news that the Blood Axe might be located at the end of the Naihe Bridge. As such, I ventured onto the bridge. However, before I reached the end…” He paused after speaking up to that point.  </p>
			<p> Well, he was stopped by the five monster kings and his fate was clear for all to see. </p>
			<p> “Oh? The blood axe is located at the end of the Naihe Bridge?!” Huang Xiaolong yelled in shock. </p>
			<p> If he managed to obtain the axe, he would have seven universe treasures! 𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> He would hold a majority of the treasures alone! </p>
			<p> “Yes. I am more than eighty percent sure that the Blood Axe is here.” Zhu Chen nodded. “However, no one has been able to reach the end of the bridge!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the five monster kings. </p>
			<p> The face of the Blood Tentacle Monster King turned serious and he muttered, “Not even we managed to reach the end of the bridge. That’s because the region at the end belongs to the Ghost Devil King!” </p>
			<p> “Ghost Devil King?” Huang Xiaolong and Zhu Chen were taken aback. </p>
			<p> That was the first time Zhu Chen was hearing the name, </p>
			<p> The Golden Centipede King muttered, “The Ghost Devil King was born during the creation of the universe, just like us. No… He’s slightly older than us if we need to be specific. Moreover, he’s extremely mysterious and he never shows his face! He never leaves the Naihe Bridge and he’s stronger than all five of us!” </p>
			<p> “All the evil ghosts in the Netherworld can be said to be his descendants! </p>
			<p> The Yin Ant King continued, “Even the Green Ghost doesn’t know about his existence. We’re the only five who know about the Ghost Devil King.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned. “How strong is he exactly?” </p>
			<p> The five monster kings looked at each other as a look of confusion appeared on their faces. </p>
			<p> “We have no idea…” The Black Locust King shook his head and sighed, “We only exchanged blows with him once, and all five of us were defeated by him easily. I’m afraid that the power he has is much stronger than what you displayed earlier.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> How could he be so strong?! </p>
			<p> Initially, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Ghost Devil King couldn’t be much stronger than himself. Who would have thought that he could defeat the five of them easily? </p>
			<p> He only managed to suppress them with the help of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Three Gods Halberd, the Reversal Sword, and the four Universe Origin Fires. </p>
			<p> Even though he was still hiding some trump cards by holding back his strength and the Universe Boat, that was close to all he had! With the Universe Boat, defeating the five would be easier, but it wouldn’t be effortless! </p>
			<p> A light flashed in his eyes as he looked towards the end of the bridge. </p>
			<p> “How far are we from the end?” Huang Xiaolong asked.  </p>
			<p> “If you fly over with your fastest speed, you’ll need half a year to get there.” The Yin Ant King replied after thinking about it for a moment. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Huang Xiaolong was appalled. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen was similarly stunned. </p>
			<p> He thought that he was close to the end after running into the five monster kings, but he was wrong! </p>
			<p> Half a year! </p>
			<p> With Zhu Chen’s speed, he would be able to cross the entire region owned by the Green Ghost if he flew for half a year, much less Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> How could the Naihe Bridge be so damn long?! </p>
			<p> “Lord, since we know that the Blood Axe is located at the end of the bridge, we can look for it next time.” The Blood Tentacle Monster King said. </p>
			<p> He might not have said it, but his meaning was clear. Huang Xiaolong was no match for the Ghost Devil King. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong glanced at the Blood Tentacle King from the corner of his eye and he eventually sighed, “Alright.” </p>
			<p> He made several calculations before accepting the suggestion. Even if he used the Universe Boat and got the assistance of everyone present, he might be able to fight the Ghost Devil King to a draw. He might as well return to cutivate before coming back to suppress the Ghost Devil King after breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> The moment he broke through, his strength would take a huge leap forward! </p>

			<p> Of course, he didn’t leave the Naihe Bridge immediately. He planned to refine the Golden Sun Circlet before leaving. </p>
			<p> The bridge might have been dangerous before he subdued the five kings, but now that things were different, there no longer existed anything that could threaten him! </p>
			<p> Sitting down on the ground, he started to refine the treasure. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen and the five kings stood around him to defend the area. </p>
			<p> With all of them around, not a single monster dared to approach. </p>
			<p> Silence filed the land as he started to refine the treasure. </p>
			<p> Countless years passed in a flash and Huang Xiaolong completed the refinement process. </p>
			<p> However, he thought of something before leaving. He retrieved the golden cloth he obtained in the battle with the golden robed young man and he asked Zhu Chen, “I ran into a young man wearing golden robes earlier and we fought a little. This came from his clothes. Do you recognize it?” </p>
			<p> “Golden robes?” Zhu Chen frowned. He started to examine the cloth in Huang Xiaolong’s hand and his expression changed drastically. “Could it be?!”  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt that Zhu Chen had already guessed the man’s identity from his reaction. </p>
			<p> “Who is that guy?” </p>
			<p> “Lord, he… Did he use a giant golden cloth and huge golden cymbals?” Zhu Chen asked. </p>
			<p> “Yes he did.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> “Then it has to be him! He’s the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race!” </p>
			<p> “Universe First Race?!” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in confusion. </p>
			<p> Like Huang Xiaolong, the five monster kings were equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> “Yes. He’s the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race!” Zhu Chen explained. “Since the start of time, the thirteen universes gave birth to a supreme race that existed before the creation of everything else! They are known as the Universe First Race. When the universe was destroyed previously, they were behind it all!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. “What?!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, they did it!” Zhu Chen continued, “There are thirteen kings in the Universe First Race. The Golden Cymbals King is ranked somewhere in the middle among them!”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3688 – Strongest in the Universe&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Ranked in the middle?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> The Golden Cymbals King had crossed the 27 billion units mark in terms of combat abilities. Wouldn’t that mean that there were at least six people stronger than that?! </p>
			<p> “That’s right!” Zhu Chen’s expression was sullen when he spoke about the Universe First Race. “As the race that was born before the creation of everything else, they are the strongest people in existence. I heard that the Black Nether King who’s the strongest among them is comparable to a true Universe God!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank when he heard the news. </p>
			<p> Black Nether God! </p>
			<p> He wasn’t a Universe God, but he was comparable to one! </p>
			<p> As he continued to cultivate, the terror of a Universe God shook Huang Xiaolong to the bone. </p>
			<p> Even though the Black Nether King might not be one and he didn’t possess the ability to rule over all of existence, his strength was shocking enough! </p>
			<p> “Have you seen the Black Nether King before?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Chen.  </p>
			<p> “No.” Zhu Chen shook his head. </p>
			<p> “Huh?” </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen continued, “In the past, the Universe First Race shattered the Thirteen Universes without the involvement of the Black Nether King. Because of the Ferocious Devil, we managed to survive as we moved to the Unknown Space. If the Black Nether King had moved against the universes in the past, nothing would be left.” </p>
			<p> When he thought about how the universes were destroyed, he felt his heart palpitating with fear. </p>
			<p> The destruction of the universe caused a powerful shockwave to spread through every inch of existence. No one could escape their fate. Ancient races were destroyed and even half step Universe Gods were turned into dust. </p>
			<p> Massive continent, holy world, and even great worlds were destroyed! </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen clenched his fist as the blood drained from his face. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s expression was equally as ugly. </p>
			<p> The Black Nether King didn’t even do anything in the past. Yet, the Thirteen Universes were destroyed! If he personally appeared, who in the world would be able to hold him back? </p>
			<p> Even if Huang Xiaolong joined hands with the Ferocious Devil, they might not be able to do a thing! </p>
			<p> In fact, he might not be a match for the Black Nether King even if he managed to gather all thirteen universe treasures! </p>
			<p> One might be able to gain an unimaginable amount of strength after they gathered all thirteen universe treasures. However, one’s cultivation base was all that mattered. Nothing mattered if one’s cultivation realm was low! Compared to experts like the Black Nether King, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was too damn low! </p>
			<p> “When we seeked refuge in the Unknown Space, we laid down countless restrictions to hide our presence. We should be able to detect the presence of any members of the Universe First Race as soon as they enter our region!” Zhu Chen realized how serious the problem was all of a sudden and he gasped. “How in the world did the Golden Cymbals King enter the Netherworld without us detecting anything?” </p>
			<p> “Did the restrictions lose their effect?” </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen’s voice turned cold. </p>
			<p> The appearance of the Golden Cymbals King caused fear to sprout in his heart. </p>
			<p> An uneasy feeling filled his mind. </p>
			<p> They had been at peace with the Universe First Race ever since they relocated to the Unknown Space. Even though the members of the Universe First Race knew of their presence, they didn’t launch any attack against them. The thirteen kings of the Universe First Race didn’t choose to hunt them down to the last man standing! </p>
			<p> That was because they were afraid of the Ferocious Devil! </p>
			<p> Now, the Golden Cymbals King came over sneakily and destroyed the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation in order to cause chaos in the Unknown Space! </p>
			<p> Wouldn’t that mean that the Universe First Race was starting to move against them?! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong naturally thought of everything Zhu Chen could think of. </p>
			<p> With his expression sinking slightly, Huang Xiaolong realized that if the Universe First Race moved against the Unknown Space, they would definitely do something to the Thirteen Universes! </p>
			<p> When that happened, the Blazing Dragon World, Pangu World, and the other great worlds would be destroyed for sure! </p>
			<p> With his strength, he might be able to escape into some pocket of space, but his family and friends would definitely die! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong clenched his fists tightly together. </p>
			<p> “Are you able to contact the Ferocious Devil?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Chen all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen shook his head and sighed, “Lord Devil hasn’t appeared in a long time. No one knows where he went. Not even the Dragon Overlord or the God of Death knows where he is!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> “The only person who might know where Lord Devil is is the Green Ghost.” Zhu Chen muttered. </p>
			<p> “Green Ghost?!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right. Lord Green Ghost might know where Lord Devil is. However, Lord Green Ghost hasn’t appeared for quite some time. There are some who say that Lord Green Ghost is currently hiding in some secret space with Lord Devil in order to comprehend the grand dao. Lord Devil has been hiding in seclusion all this time in order to raise his strength to fight against the members of the Universe First Race.” </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen hesitated for a moment and he continued, “According to Lord Devil, the Universe First Race will definitely destroy the Thirteen Universes a second time since they already did it in the past.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. He was afraid of that. </p>
			<p> In fact, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that the Universe First Race would move against the Thirteen Universes soon. </p>
			<p> “Why do they wish to destroy the universe?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “I have no idea. However, Lord Devil guessed that it has something to do with the Black Nether King breaking through to the Universe God Realm.” </p>
			<p> It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “?!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Doesn’t that mean that the Black Nether King wishes to use the lives of the Thirteen Universes to break through?”  </p>
			<p> “That’s possible.” Zhu Chen nodded and continued, “He failed previously, and he might try again this time.” </p>
			<p> As such, there might be a second and even third time! </p>
			<p> He would do it again and again until he entered the Universe God Realm! </p>
			<p> In order to save the Thirteen Universes, there was only one option! He had to get rid of the Black Nether King! </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Ferocious Devil. 𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> Gui Chi might be the Green Ghost’s close aide, but he had no idea what went on with the Ferocious Devil. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong learned how strong the Ferocious Devil was from Zhu Chen. His combat strength has already crossed the 29 billion mark. However, Zhu Chen wasn’t exactly sure how strong he was! </p>
			<p> Next, Huang Xiaolong asked if Zhu Chen and the others were really trapped in the Unknown Space. After all, he heard that they would draw over a terrifying tribulation if they left. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen nodded his head and explained, “That is true. We might have escaped from the Thirteen Universes in the past when it was getting destroyed, but we were struck by the curse that came along with the destruction. We only managed to suppress the curse using the power of the Unknown Space. If we leave, we’ll definitely draw over the destruction tribulation.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank. If Zhu Chen and the others were unable to leave the Unknown Space, he wouldn’t be able to count on them when he fought with the Universe First Race in the future!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3689 – Battling the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> He wouldn’t be able to get the assistance of the Ferocious Devil when the day of reckoning came! </p>
			<p> The Ferocious Devil had a combat power of more than 29 billion marks of grand cosmos energy! The battle would be much more manageable with his help! </p>
			<p> Next, Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Universe First Race. </p>
			<p> Of course, Zhu Chen only had limited knowledge on the Universe First Race. He knew that there were thirteen kings among them and he had a general understanding of their strength. That was about it. </p>
			<p> He had no idea what any of the kings cultivated. </p>
			<p> An hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the Naihe Bridge with Zhu Chen. </p>
			<p> The five monster kings followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> With their presence, no creatures dared to attack the group on their way out. </p>
			<p> Right before they left, Huang Xiaolong turned around to stare in the direction of the end of the bridge. He decided to return after breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage!  </p>
			<p> He would meet the Ghost Devil King in the future! </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen and the others might not be able to leave the Unknown Space, but Huang Xiaolong learned that the monster kings of the Naihe Bridge weren’t restricted by the curse! </p>
			<p> If he subdued the Ghost Devil King in the future, he would definitely gain another powerful ally! </p>
			<p> After traveling for a year, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the entrance of the Naihe Bridge. </p>
			<p> When Zhu Chen saw the entrance of the bridge, his heart thumped in excitement. If Huang Xiaolong hadn’t arrived when he did, he might never have been able to leave the Naihe Bridge! </p>
			<p> After they left, they appeared before the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sealed off the altar before entering the bridge, stopping any evil ghosts from running out into the Unknown Space. </p>
			<p> “Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> They would talk about other matters when they left the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> With Zhu Chen and the five monster kings behind him, Huang Xiaolong went towards the seventeenth level. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong took out the Universe Boat as he felt that they were traveling too slowly. </p>
			<p> When Zhu Chen saw the giant boat appearing above his head, his jaws dropped. </p>
			<p> The five monster kings gave similar reactions. </p>
			<p> “Universe Boat!” Zhu Chen yelled. </p>
			<p> “Yep.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “If we travel alone, we’ll be too slow.” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, he got on the ship. </p>
			<p> Everyone followed closely behind. </p>
			<p> Looking at the giant ship they boarded, Zhu Chen and the others felt a sense of disbelief rising in their minds. </p>
			<p> Was that really the Universe Boat?! A trace of doubt formed in Zhu Chen’s mind. </p>
			<p> However, that doubt was soon cleared. </p>
			<p> The moment Huang Xiaolong activated the grand formation on the ship to propel them forward, he realized that the Universe Boat was the real deal! It was too f*cking fast! </p>
			<p> With their shocking speed, they tore through the Netherworld.  </p>
			<p> Because of Huang Xiaolong’s seclusion in the Yin Soul River, his understanding of the grand dao increased by a huge amount! </p>
			<p> Search FreeWebNovel.com for the original. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen’s understanding of the grand dao wasn’t something Gui Chi or the others could compare to! Even Jian Wushuang was far from him! </p>
			<p> As for the five monster kings, they were probably a little better than Zhu Chen. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong discussed the dao with them, he felt a whole new door opening before his eyes! </p>
			<p> Several dozen years passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> Even though it had only been a short amount of time, Huang Xiaolong gained a whole new understanding in the intricacies of the universe and the grand dao. </p>
			<p> Feeling that something was off, Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls to scan the situation around the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> He quickly discovered the experts who entered the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> Even though he hadn’t met the Dragon Overlord or the God of Death, he recognized them immediately. </p>
			<p> He wasn’t surprised to see that they were present. After all, he didn’t hide his tracks after leaving the Yin Soul River. He knew that they would follow him into the Netherworld. </p>
			<p> It seemed as though the Reversal Sword was an extremely alluring treasure. The experts of the various regions didn’t care about the evil ghosts at all as they killed their way into the Netherworld in search of him. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen and the others felt that it was odd that Huang Xiaolong slowed down all of a sudden. </p>
			<p> “Lord, this…” Zhu Chen asked. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong glanced at him from the corner of his eye and chuckled, “The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death came.” </p>
			<p> “?!” Zhu Chen was struck dumb by his revelation. 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯ℴ𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> “I obtained the Reversal Sword in the Yin Soul River and the news probably reached them. The masters of several great regions, along with the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death brought their armies along to the Netherworld.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> “Several region masters?!” Zhu Chen gasped. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly kept the Universe Boat as he stood in the middle of the air to wait for their arrival. </p>
			<p> Several moments later, Zhu Chen and the five monster kings detected their presence. </p>
			<p> Even though Zhu Chen was one of the supreme overlords in the Unknown Space, his expression changed when he saw the powerful army charging towards them. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord and God of Death quickly noticed the group.  </p>
			<p> The two supreme overlords stared at each other silently as they were surprised that Huang Xiaolong would wait for them to come. </p>
			<p> They couldn’t understand why Zhu Chen was part of Huang Xiaolong’s group. Did the two know each other?! </p>
			<p> Moreover, they were shocked to discover the presence of the five giant monster kings. </p>
			<p> Every single one of them possessed an aura no weaker than Zhu Chen! </p>
			<p> “The monster kings of the Naihe Bridge?!” The Dragon Overlord gasped. </p>
			<p> Why would they be together with Huang Xiaolong and Zhu Chen?! Moreover, they seemed to be extremely respectful when they looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Even though they were confused, they led their armies towards the group. It didn’t take long for them to run into each other. </p>
			<p> The two groups stood opposite each other and the armies of the various factions stared at Huang Xiaolong’s party in confusion. </p>
			<p> Stepping up slightly, the Dragon Overlord growled, “Zhu Chen, we’re here for the kid. This has nothing to do with you.” </p>
			<p> Before Zhu Chen could say anything, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop the man. He stepped forward and flew towards the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3690 – Solo Battle&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The two were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong’s approach. </p>
			<p> The experts of the various regions stared at each other in confusion. </p>
			<p> “Is Huang Xiaolong planning to fight against the two alone?!” The Nefarious Golden Master mocked. </p>
			<p> “Hahaha! It’s possible!” A youngster who covered half his face sneered. “He even dares to kill the Yin Reversal King and Yang Nether King! Of course he’s confident enough to take on the two of them at the same time!” </p>
			<p> Everyone broke into laughter. </p>
			<p> The person who spoke was called Wei Zheng. He was comparable in strength to Gui Chi and his combat abilities closed in on the 20 billion mark. He was an existence who was only second to the supreme overlords! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong quickly arrived before the two. </p>
			<p> “You can come at me together.” Huang Xiaolong stated in a flat tone. </p>
			<p> The moment the words left his lips, everyone broke out into laughter.  </p>
			<p> “Hahaha! We’re right!” </p>
			<p> The Nefarious Golden Master sneered, “He’s tired of living. Does he think that the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death are as weak as the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King?!” </p>
			<p> Both the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death frowned when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> “Brat, are you planning to fight us alone?!” The Dragon Overlord roared. His voice was thunderous and everyone felt their ears ringing. “Do you really think you have the capabilities to battle the two of us at once?” </p>
			<p> The God of Death slowly approached Huang Xiaolong. “I’m more than enough if we wish to kill you. I’ll give you a chance to show off your Reversal Sword.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s strength couldn’t be underestimated after he killed the two kings. His strength might have crossed the 20 billion mark, but the God of Death was confident that he could take Huang Xiaolong on no matter how strong he was. </p>
			<p> With his combat strength at the 23 billion mark, he still had the Blade of Death to assist him. Not even the Dragon Overlord was confident of defeating him! </p>
			<p> That was because he had the ability to control death! He was indestructible! </p>
			<p> No matter how strong one’s attack was, it couldn’t affect his fleshy body. </p>
			<p> “Why would I need the Reversal Sword to deal with you?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed. </p>
			<p> The God of Death scoffed when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> “Since that’s what you think…” The Blade of Death appeared in his hand and he stabbed at Huang Xiaolong without any warning. </p>
			<p> The Blade of Death was extremely quick. The God of Death didn’t use any superfluous movement and his blade arrived beside Huang Xiaolong’s neck in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong casually grabbed the blade with his fingers. </p>
			<p> In front of everyone present, the Blade of Death was stuck between Huang Xiaolong’s fingers! </p>
			<p> The God of Death, the Dragon Overlord, and the various region masters stared at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief in their eyes. </p>
			<p> Casually flicking the body of the blade, Huang Xiaolong wanted to see how strong the weapon actually was. </p>
			<p> Clang! </p>
			<p> A clear ringing sound filled the skies. </p>
			<p> A terrifying shockwave swept through the lands, forcing the God of Death to retreat several dozen thousand miles. </p>
			<p> When he landed on the ground, the rumbling didn’t stop for a long time. </p>
			<p> The sudden change caused everyone to stand rooted to their spots as their world view crumbled before them. </p>
			<p> Not even the Dragon Overlord believed what he saw. </p>
			<p> No one expected Huang Xiaolong to send the God of Death flying with a single tap! </p>
			<p> Ignoring everyone, Huang Xiaolong walked towards the Dragon Overlord and sighed, “It’s your turn.” </p>
			<p> Next, he looked at the region masters and continued, “You’re free to attack me in a group.” </p>
			<p> Search &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; for the original. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> A weird light flashed in Wei Zheng’s and others’ eyes. It was evident that they were thinking of working together to deal with Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Even though they had no idea how Huang Xiaolong really was, they knew that he was stronger than the Dragon Overlord since he sent the God of Death flying easily. </p>
			<p> They knew that they were no match for him individually. </p>
			<p> When they were still hesitating, Huang Xiaolong moved. He appeared in front of Wei Zheng and the Nefarious Golden Master before sending a punch their way. 𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝓂</p>
			<p> Their expressions changed drastically as they tried to retreat. It was too bad they failed to dodge the punch. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s fist slammed heavily into their chests </p>
			<p> The sound of bones shattering filled the air. </p>
			<p> Everyone saw their innards being beaten out of their bodies. </p>
			<p> The Nefarious Golden Master’s strength ranked in the middle of the group, but he was comparable to Wei Zheng and Gui Chi! With his strength, he was nowhere comparable to Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p> Wei Zheng’s physical body was like paper in front of Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Everyone who wanted to attack Huang Xiaolong second guessed themselves. They realized that they might not be able to defeat him even if they worked together. </p>
			<p> Under their terrified gaze, Huang Xiaolong sent a punch towards the Dragon Overlord. </p>
			<p> Reacting instantly, a pair of flame wheels appeared in his hand. </p>
			<p> One of them was dark and the other was burning bright. </p>
			<p> They were the Yin Yang Flame Wheels. </p>
			<p> When the Dragon Overlord waved the wheels together, a terrifying tornado was formed. </p>
			<p> The tornado attempted to block Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s fist didn’t slow down as it tore through the tornado. It smashed straight into the Dragon Overlord’s chest. </p>
			<p> Like the God of Death, the Dragon Overlord was sent flying. He landed beside the God of Death.  </p>
			<p> Everyone sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> They might have tried to overestimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but they were far from it! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t continue his assault as he looked at the two casually. </p>
			<p> The God of Death and the Dragon Overlord crawled to their feet and fear filled their hearts. </p>
			<p> “Who the hell are you?!” The Dragon Overlord yelled. </p>
			<p> “Do you remember Huang Sheng?” Huang Xiaolong replied with a question of his own. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord stared at him in silence. “Are you talking about Huang Sheng from the Thirteen Universes?” </p>
			<p> “Yes.” Huang Xiaolong summoned the Sun Moon Furnace and he released Huang Sheng along with Meng Tian. </p>
			<p> The moment they appeared, they stared at the group of experts surrounding them in fright. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Dragon Overlord!” They exclaimed with disbelief and they felt as though their savior had appeared.</p>

			</title>
			<p>However, they felt that something was wrong when they examined the Dragon Overlord closely. It seemed as though he was really hurt!</p>
			<p>How could anyone injure an expert at the Dragon Overlord’s level?!</p>
			<p>Huang Sheng and the others saw the look in the Dragon Overlord’s eyes, and they slowly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Could it be?!</p>
			<p>“It’s you!” the Dragon Overlord roared when he saw Huang Sheng and Meng Tian. “You’re from the Thirteen Universes!” </p>
			<p>Initially, Huang Sheng and Meng Tian had told him about Huang Xiaolong when they joined him.</p>
			<p>Soon after, they disappeared, and he guessed that it had something to do with Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Looking at the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I’ll tell you now, Zhu Chen has already submitted to me.”</p>
			<p>“What?!” 𝑓𝓇𝘦𝘦𝓌𝘦𝑏𝘯𝘰𝑣𝘦𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚 </p>
			<p>“Lord Zhu Chen chose to serve Huang Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p>Wei Zheng and the others gasped in shock as they turned to look at Zhu Chen.</p>
			<p>“That’s right! I am Lord Huang’s subordinate!” Zhu Chen nodded.</p>
			<p>!!</p>
			<p>Lord Zhu Chen actually chose to serve the kid!</p>
			<p>Everyone found it hard to believe, but he already admitted the matter.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen was one of the pillars of the Unknown Space. However, he chose to serve someone from the Thirteen Universes!</p>
			<p>“Zhu Chen, how dare you betray Lord Devil?!” Wei Zheng roared with rage.</p>
			<p>Even though Zhu Chen, the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and the Green Ghost stood alongside the Ferocious Devil as the five supreme overlords of the Unknown Space, everyone knew who was the true ruler of the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil was the one who called the shots!</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen didn’t fly into a rage. Instead, he muttered, “I didn’t betray Lord Devil. Lord Huang Xiaolong is the same as us. We have the same enemy, and that’s the Universe First Race!” </p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord sneered, “You’re a traitor and that’s that. There’s no need for your excuses. Zhu Chen, now that you submitted to an outsider, you’re an enemy of our Unknown Space!”</p>
			<p>“All of you, take them down!” the God of Death roared.</p>
			<p>“Kill!” </p>
			<p>Every single expert from the Unknown Space charged towards Huang Xiaolong at once.</p>
			<p>“You don’t know what’s good for you…” Huang Xiaolong sneered.</p>
			<p>The Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared above Huang Xiaolong, and he summoned the four Universe Origin Fires. A sea of flames surrounded the entire group.</p>
			<p>“Star Dragon Divine Tree!” </p>
			<p>“That’s the four Universe Origin Fires!” </p>
			<p>Yells rang through the skies.</p>
			<p>The branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree moved all of a sudden.</p>
			<p>Without a single exception, everyone was sent flying.</p>
			<p>The origin fires landed on the experts of the Unknown Space when they were flying away.</p>
			<p>No matter how hard they tried, they failed to shake off the flames that stuck to them like superglue. </p>
			<p>It quickly burned through their armor before landing on their physical bodies.</p>
			<p>Miserable shrieks filled the skies.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death didn’t dare to challenge the flames directly, and they dodged every single strand of flame flying towards them.</p>
			<p>It was too bad the flames weren’t the only thing they had to be aware of. Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared before them. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd that appeared in his hand chopped at them.</p>
			<p>The two of them raised their weapons in a desperate attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Without any fanfare, the two of them were sent flying.</p>
			<p>They realized that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was basically two times what he displayed earlier! They felt a warm feeling rising from their chest and they spat out a mouthful of blood each.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord’s combat abilities might have crossed the 24 billion mark, but he was far from Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy, much less the man’s combat abilities. </p>
			<p>There was even less to say for the God of Death.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong appeared before them once again and he struck out with both weapons.</p>
			<p>Their expressions changed.</p>
			<p>The Reversal Sword plunged straight into the God of Death’s chest.</p>
			<p>As for the Dragon Overlord, he was a little better off as he was sent smashing into the ground by the Three Gods Halberd. At the very least, he didn’t turn into a human kebab.</p>
			<p>When the experts of the Unknown Space thought that Huang Xiaolong was too busy to deal with them, a blood sea charged towards them and the five monster kings moved.</p>
			<p>Wei Zheng and the others were sent flying before they could try anything.</p>
			<p>Pulling his sword out from the God of Death’s chest, Huang Xiaolong sent him flying into the ground below with a single punch.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>One day later…</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death pledged their alliance to Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>By the time they did, they were beaten up so badly that their bodies trembled when he approached.</p>
			<p>No one managed to escape as Huang Xiaolong caught every single one of them.</p>
			<p>Naturally, the Yin Yang Flame Wheels and the Blade of Death went to Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of joy rising in his heart when he held the two treasures.</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, the Universe Origin Fires, the Three Gods Halberd, The Reversal Sword, Golden Sun Circlet, Yin Yang Flame Wheels, and the Blade of Death belonged to him! Out of the thirteen treasures, he held eight of them! </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to leave the Netherworld as he started to refine the treasures.</p>
			<p>As peace returned to the Netherworld, Yin Qi, who was standing outside the entrance of the Netherworld, stared at the entrance in shock.</p>
			<p>“City Lord, should we enter the Netherworld?” Yin Guan asked.</p>
			<p>However, Yin Qi shook his head and sighed, “There is no need for that. Now that Lord Dragon Overlord has captured Huang Xiaolong, he should be back in several years.”</p>
			<p>Yin Guan wanted to say something, but he eventually swallowed his words.</p>
			<p>More than twenty years had passed and Huang Xiaolong finally refined their treasures. They left for the entrance of the Netherworld.</p>
			<p>Several years passed…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and the others finally saw the entrance to the Netherworld, and they wasted no time as they charged out from the god-forsaken place.</p>
			<p>When Yin Qi and the others saw Huang Xiaolong returning from the Netherworld, they stared in shock.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong paused for a second before approaching Yin Qi.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3692 – Devil Land&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Yin Guan felt his body turning stiff when Huang Xiaolong approached him with Zhu Chen, the Dragon Overlord, and the God of Death following closely behind. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong!” Yin Guan’s voice trembled. </p>
			<p> With the three of them following behind Huang Xiaolong respectfully, Yin Guan had no idea what was going on. </p>
			<p> “Where’s your city lord?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “He… He… He’s in the City Lord Manor,” Yin Guan stuttered. “I’ll bring all of you over now!” </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord sneered when he heard what Yin Guan said. “Are you asking us to follow you into the manor to meet the city lord?” </p>

			<p> Yin Guan jumped in fright, and he waved his hand in panic. “No… No… That’s not what I meant! I’ll report this to Lord Yin Qi immediately! He’ll personally come out to welcome you!” His legs went soft and he nearly fell to his knees. </p>
			<p> “What are you so afraid of?” The Dragon Overlord chucked when he saw the look on Yin Guan’s face.  </p>
			<p> “I… I’m not afraid!” Yin Guan stammered. </p>
			<p> “What?! You’re not afraid of us?!” The God of Death frowned. </p>
			<p> Yin Guan opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was like a fish out of the water as he tried to rack his brains for the right words to say. </p>
			<p> “Enough. Stop messing around with him.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “It’s alright. We’ll follow you back to the manor. Get him to wait for us there. I’ll leave after asking him some questions.” </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord and God of Death shut their mouths the instant Huang Xiaolong spoke. </p>
			<p> When Yin Guan saw the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death’s subservience, his heart pounded with fear. He turned to Huang Xiaolong and stuttered, “Yes… Lord Huang Xiaolong, I will notify the City Lord right now!” After he spoke, he brought the whole group towards the city lord manor. At the same time, he sent a report to Yin Qi about everything he saw. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and the masters of their various regions followed behind Huang Xiaolong. With the experts they brought along with them, there were more than a million people following behind Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Everyone in the city fell to their knees wherever the group of experts passed. 𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝒏𝙤𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p> When everything was going on outside, Yin Qi was sitting in his manor as he trained his daughter, Yin Ping, in the way of the sword. His transmission symbol trembled slightly and he saw that it was from Yin Guan. Casually sweeping through the contents, he felt as though his mind was struck by a lightning bolt. </p>
			<p> “Father, what’s wrong?” Yin Ping asked when she saw the look on his face. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi opened his mouth slightly, but he didn’t say a word as he handed the report over to his daughter. </p>
			<p> When she read the contents of the report, her eyes widened with shock. </p>
			<p> “What?! Lord Huang Xiaolong is currently leading the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Lord Zhu Chen, and the various regional masters towards the City Lord Manor?!” </p>
			<p> “Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen are extremely respectful to him!” </p>
			<p> “This… This can’t be true, right?!” </p>
			<p> Yin Ping felt her heart pounding in her chest. </p>
			<p> “Father… Father!” A moment later, she snapped back to reality and she saw Yin Qi standing there like a wooden chicken. She couldn’t help but ask, “Senior… Seniors Yin Guan said that they are currently heading to the manor!” </p>
			<p> “Should we head out to welcome them?” </p>
			<p> Yin Qi woke up from his daze and quickly ran towards the entrance of the manor. “Hurry! Summon every single expert in the manor to welcome Lord Huang and the others!” </p>
			<p> With a single order from Yin Qi, the entire City Lord Manor fell into chaos. </p>
			<p> The experts who were eating, sleeping, or meditating, got to their feet, and they ran out with the fastest speed possible. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might have said that it was alright for Yin Qi to welcome them alone, but there was no way Yin Qi had the guts to do that! The Dragon Overlord who was known for his explosive temper was following closely behind, and if he pissed the man off, they would be in for a world of pain. They charged out en masse to welcome Huang Xiaolong’s party. </p>
			<p> Not too long after, they saw Huang Xiaolong leading a group of more than a million experts following behind him. The most notable of them were the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the various region masters! </p>
			<p> Even after all that he had been through, Yin Qi didn’t know what to do! </p>
			<p> He ran over to Huang Xiaolong hastily and he got to his knees. “Yin Qi greets Lord Huang Xiaolong, Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen!” </p>
			<p> His daughter and the experts of the manor got to their knees after him. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “City Lord Yin Qi, you’ve become so formal after several dozen years… Please get up!” </p>
			<p> Only then did Yin Qi and the experts of the City Lord Manor dare to get up. </p>
			<p> “Let’s enter the manor. We’ll talk about the other stuff later.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I’ve heard that this is the greatest city in the Green Ghost Land. I wish to take a look around your manor…” </p>
			<p> Yin Qi grinned in embarrassment. “It’s our honor.” </p>
			<p> Soon after, he brought them into the City Lord Manor. </p>
			<p> Long before he left to welcome them, he ordered for a banquet to be prepared. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the main hall of the manor, Yin Qi invited Huang Xiaolong and the various supreme overlords to take a seat. </p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong took the main seat and the others chose to sit on the seats a level lower. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi felt his throat going dry when he understood the meaning behind their seating arrangements. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong asked Yin Qi about everything and anything during the banquet. They spoke about the Netherworld, the city itself, and Huang Xiaolong also spoke about his meeting with the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race. He also told everyone that the Golden Cymbals King stole the Ghost Staff from the eye of the formation. </p>
			<p> Yin Qi felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead when he thought about the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong left the city after staying for one entire day. </p>
			<p> After leaving, he brought the entire party towards the Devil Land. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Huang Xiaolong got the various supreme overlords and the region masters to send their troops back. The only people who were following him to the Devil Land were the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, the five monster kings, and the region masters. </p>
			<p> There was no doubt about it. There was only one goal in his mind. Huang Xiaolong wished to look for the Ferocious Devil. </p>
			<p> The appearance of the Universe First Race caused worry to burn in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. The sense of threat he felt pressed down on his heart like a mountain. He came to look for the Ferocious Devil as he wanted to form an alliance to resist the members of the Universe First Race. </p>
			<p> It would take him an entire year to travel to the Devil Land even if he used the Universe Boat. As such, he used the time to discuss the dao with the three supreme overlords. </p>
			<p> With all of them by his side to test out his understanding of his techniques Huang Xiaolong gradually managed to comprehend three different types of techniques. </p>
			<p> One year passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in the Devil Land as planned. </p>
			<p> The Green Ghost Land might be covered in weird negative qi, but the Devil Land was not. Although both regions had no sunlight, the Devil Land gave off a feeling of freedom one hardly ever felt.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3693 – That Looks Like the Nefarious Golden Master!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Devil qi pervaded the lands and Huang Xiaolong casually grabbed a ball of devil qi with a swing of his arms. The ball of devil qi rolled about as though it had a consciousness of its own. </p>
			<p> “The devil qi is an extremely pure form of spiritual energy!” Huang Xiaolong gasped. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen chuckled, “The Devil Land is the place with the purest spiritual qi in the Unknown Space! Not even the Green Ghost Land can compare to it!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded. </p>
			<p> After standing there for some time, Huang Xiaolong exhaled, “Allright. Let’s go to the Devil Capital.” </p>
			<p> The Devil Capital was the largest city in the Devil Land. It was also the core of the Devil Race. </p>
			<p> As the region owned by the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, it was naturally the place where the strongest gathered. </p>
			<p> The Ferocious Devil’s combat strength had passed the 29 billion mark. One could only imagine how terrifying he was! </p>
			<p> Several months passed…  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others finally arrived in the Devil Capital. </p>
			<p> The Devil Capital stood in the middle of a mountain range. It spanned god knew how many miles, and it was covered in a dense cloud of devil qi. It emitted mysterious air. </p>
			<p> Keeping the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the city gates. </p>
			<p> The city was bustling and there were disciples of the great devil sects walking about casually. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others walked about the city as they slowly made their way over to the imperial palace. </p>
			<p> According to the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death, the Ferocious Devil’s son, Mo Kun, might have an idea. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong and the others were traveling over, a commotion broke out in the city. </p>
			<p> “The Heaven Secret Devil Prince and the Wavering Light Prince are fighting!” </p>
			<p> “Hahaha! It’s normal!” </p>
			<p> “Let’s run! The shockwaves of the battle are bound to sweep us up! If we get caught up in the battle, we’re in trouble!” </p>
			<p> “In the past, there was an eminent elder of a certain family who was beaten up. The two races couldn’t come to an agreement for his compensation, and they beat him up again!” </p>
			<p> The experts in the surrounding started to flee at the quickest speed possible. </p>
			<p> “Heaven Secret Devil Race? Wavering Light Devil Race?” Huang Xiaolong turned to ask the rest. </p>
			<p> One of the region masters approached and explained, “Lord, the ancestors of the two races are ordinary half step Universe Gods.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. </p>
			<p> That meant that their grand cosmos energy hadn’t crossed the 10 billion mark. </p>
			<p> They might be existences akin to the heavens in the eyes of ordinary experts, but they were nothing more than tiny little ants to everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s party. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong realized who they were, the battle started to progress over to their side. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the scuffle and he chuckled towards the Dragon Overlord and the others, “Why don’t you go warm up your muscles?” </p>
			<p> They stared at each other and laughed. </p>
			<p> A rare smile appeared on the God of Death’s face. “Forget it… If we go up there, we can’t even breathe properly for fear of killing them. </p>
			<p> Laughter filled the skies once again. </p>
			<p> When they were in the midst of laughter, the princes arrived before Huang Xiaolong and the others. </p>
			<p> As they didn’t care about their surroundings, a massive hurricane was swept up near Huang Xiaolong’s group. </p>
			<p> Of course, the shockwaves and storm dissipated before they could run through Huang Xiaolong and the others. </p>
			<p> When they approached Huang Xiaolong, they were sent flying by a wave of formless energy. </p>
			<p> Eating a mouthful of dirt, they finally stopped their fight. </p>
			<p> The experts who followed them around quickly went up to the two when they saw that the battle came to a pause. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Secret Prince stared at Huang Xiaolong and the others as he harrumphed, “Whoever you are, you better get lost!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong looked at the Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen as they failed to hold back their laughter. </p>
			<p> “Brat, are you really asking us to scram?!” The Dragon Overlord held his stomach as he doubled over with laughter. </p>
			<p> The Wavering Light Prince looked at the Heaven Secret Prince before looking at the various disciples who were watching the farce and he turned to the Dragon Overlord and he roared, “You’ll die a horrible death if you refuse to get out of our way! F*ck off!” </p>
			<p> This time, even the region masters behind Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> “Take them down! Beat them until their mothers wouldn’t recognize them!” The Wavering Light Prince roared at the experts standing behind him. </p>
			<p> As the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race were three times the size of a regular human, they looked extremely intimidating as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong’s group. All of them were Dao Venerables who had comprehended more than ten elements and they were pretty strong. </p>
			<p> When they approached, they were sent flying by a surge of grand cosmos energy. When they landed on the ground, no one was left conscious. </p>
			<p> Everyone who saw what happened sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> The Wavering Light Prince’s expression changed. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong turned to look at him and he muttered, “Brat, if you really want to kill us all, you need to send stronger experts over.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their reaction as he left after speaking. </p>
			<p> The members of the two races could feel the weird stares all around and their expressions turned ugly. </p>
			<p> “Who are they? How dare they offend the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race?” </p>
			<p> “How would I know? But if they dare to offend the Wavering Light Devil Race, they shouldn’t be too weak!” </p>
			<p> “That… That… Doesn’t that look like the Nefarious Golden Master?!” Someone spotted the Nefarious Golden Master at the back and he screamed, “I went to the Nefarious Golden Land in the past and I saw his statue!” </p>
			<p> The experts standing around him roared with laughter when they heard what he said. </p>
			<p> “What the f*ck are you talking about? Do you hear yourself?! There are many people who look alike! Moreover, you only saw a statue in the past!” </p>

			<p> “Why don’t you call the young man Lord Green Ghost? Hahaha!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard their discussion. </p>
			<p> Of course, he didn’t bother correcting them. He made his way to the imperial palace and they arrived after half a day. </p>
			<p> When the captain of the guards standing at the entrance saw the incoming group, he didn’t dare to be careless and he asked respectfully, “Can I help you?” </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord casually tossed over a golden plaque that had a carving of a giant golden dragon. The plaque emitted a majestic universe aura. </p>
			<p> The guard captain who caught it stared at the Dragon Overlord in shock. </p>
			<p> “I am the Dragon Overlord. Call Emperor Mo Kun out here.” </p>
			<p> What?! 𝙛𝓻𝙚𝙚𝔀𝙚𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Dragon!” The guard captain felt the blood draining from his face and his hands trembled, causing the plaque to fall. When he realized what he had done, fear filled his heart. </p>
			<p> Right before the plaque could touch the ground, Huang Xiaolong grabbed it and he handed it over to the captain. “Go make your report.”</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3694 – Dazzling Sun Princess&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The captain stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence before bowing respectfully. He held the plaque in his hand as though it was the most important thing he has ever held. </p>
			<p> The palace was large, and the guard needed several minutes to make the report. As such, Huang Xiaolong and the others were left standing outside. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was casually chatting with the others when a cry filled the skies. “The Dazzling Sun Princess is returning to the palace, everyone else, please stay away!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others looked over only to see a group of experts riding devil dragons charging towards the palace. </p>
			<p> The person leading the group was a pretty, yet aloof woman. </p>
			<p> “Dazzling Sun Princess?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord and the rest shook their heads slowly. It was clear they hadn’t heard of her. </p>
			<p> The only person who stood out to respond to Huang Xiaolong’s question was the Nefarious Golden Master. “Lord, the Dazzling Sun Princess is the daughter of Mo Kun’s youngest son. Several hundred thousand years ago, Mo Kun’s youngest son married a concubine and she gave birth to the Dazzling Sun Princess. On the day she was born, a miraculous sight was seen as a myriad of devils appeared in the skies. She was doted on by Mo Kun after her birth, and her title was granted by Mo Kun himself. </p>
			<p> “Oh.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.  </p>
			<p> It seemed as though she was pretty talented if she could catch Mo Kun’s eye. After all, he had thousands of descendants. Not everyone would be able to gain his approval. </p>
			<p> When the Dazzling Sun Princess saw Huang Xiaolong’s group standing at the entrance of the imperial palace, she couldn’t help but frown. </p>
			<p> “Are those guests of our empire?” She turned to ask someone beside her. </p>
			<p> As the strongest celestial empire in the Unknown Space, there were many guests coming over to pay their respects. </p>
			<p> She had seen too many of them, and she felt a sense of ire whenever she ran into them. She felt that all of them wanted nothing more than to latch on to her great celestial empire. </p>
			<p> “Probably…” The middle aged man beside her snorted, “These peasants have no idea what they’re doing. How dare they block the entrance of our imperial palace?! I’ll chase them away right now!” </p>
			<p> In the eyes of the experts of the Devil Capital Celestial Empire, everyone who came to pay their respects were peasants! After all, the Ferocious Devil was the strongest expert there! </p>
			<p> As the ruler of the Unknown Space, even other supreme overlords would have to listen to the Ferocious Devil! </p>
			<p> As such, he rode towards Huang Xiaolong’s group hastily and he snorted arrogantly, “Are you here to pay your respects? Can’t you see that Her Highness is currently returning to the palace?! Scram!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong and the others didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when they heard what he said. </p>
			<p> The guards tried to explain, but he was brushed aside. </p>
			<p> The middle-aged man flew into a fit of rage when he heard their laughter ringing in his ear. “What are you slaves laughing at?! Didn’t you hear what I said?! F*ck off!” </p>
			<p> “Kneel and welcome Her Highness into the palace!” </p>
			<p> When had the Dragon Overlord and the others been ordered to kneel?! Their expressions sank instantly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You can cripple them.” </p>
			<p> The One Essence Master who was standing beside the Nefarious Golden Master in the last row casually pointed at the middle aged man. He was sent flying in an instant. </p>
			<p> When he landed, the meridians in his body were shattered beyond belief. His dao heart was in a million pieces and his dao soul was damaged. The dragon beast he rode on wasn’t spared as it was reduced to cosmic dust. </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> Despite his injuries, the middle-aged man didn’t bleed a single drop of blood. </p>
			<p> No one could react in time when he was crippled by the One Essence Master. </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess gasped in fright as she looked at the middle-aged man who was sent flying towards her. </p>
			<p> Someone actually dared to make a move against someone in the imperial family right in front of the palace! </p>
			<p> The person they injured was her subordinate! </p>
			<p> The experts behind her were equally as shocked. They were used to being the biggest bullies wherever they went! They would be treated with utmost respect! </p>
			<p> Even great ancestors of the various super families would treat them respectfully! </p>
			<p> Who would dare to move against them? </p>
			<p> When the middle-aged man landed on the ground, he felt as though the world was crumbling around him when he felt his shattered meridians. </p>
			<p> Screaming with rage, he pointed at Huang Xiaolong while cursing, “You… How dare you cripple me?!” </p>
			<p> “You dog slaves, how dare you touch me!” </p>
			<p> He was a subordinate of the Dazzling Sun Princess! </p>
			<p> Running over to her side, he got to his knees and he cried, “Your Highness, please seek justice on my behalf! You cannot allow these peasants to get away!” </p>
			<p> “Kill him.” Huang Xiaolong had enough of his foul mouth. </p>
			<p> The One Essence Master pointed at the man with a single finger. </p>
			<p> This time, he exploded like an overinflated balloon. </p>
			<p> However, there was no blood to be seen.  </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess looked at his corpse in shock. </p>
			<p> “He’s dead?!” </p>
			<p> He might not be the strongest among her subordinates, but he was one of the subordinates she liked the most. After all, he was the best at flattery. 𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> “You!” She glared at Huang Xiaolong and the others. “Preposterous! How dare you do this?!” Turning around, she yelled at the rest of her subordinates, “Are all of you useless?! Hurry up and contact the experts in the palace to kill these criminals!” </p>
			<p> Snapping back to reality, they started to send out cries for reinforcement. </p>
			<p> The guards standing at the gates didn’t know what to do. </p>
			<p> After the experts behind her contacted the forces in the palace, the Dazzling Sun Princess saw the entrance to the palace opening wide as countless godly experts rushed out. </p>
			<p> The person in the lead was a middle-aged man clad in golden devil robes. </p>
			<p> He wasn’t Mo Kun, but he was the second strongest expert in the celestial empire, Devouring Devil! His status was second only to Kun Mo! </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess also discovered that there were countless eminent elders and marshals running behind Devouring Devil!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3695 – What’s Going On&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Practically every single expert in the palace emerged! </p>
			<p> She could also see her Third, Fourth, Fifth… Grandfathers running out behind Devouring Devil! After them came people of the royal family like her father, the Ice Devil. Her father stood right at the back of the line! </p>
			<p> Her eyes widened in shock. </p>
			<p> She contacted reinforcements to take the group standing outside the palace down, but she didn’t expect so many experts to appear! </p>
			<p> Moreover, every single expert who was a general or higher came out! </p>
			<p> What in the world was going on?! </p>
			<p> The status of her grandfathers was so high that she couldn’t meet them even if she wanted to! </p>
			<p> Ever since her birth, she hadn’t seen all her grandfathers gathered together! </p>
			<p> As for the subordinates behind her, there was no need to speak for them.  </p>
			<p> In fact, the Dazzling Sun Princess wasn’t the only one who was surprised. Everyone who came from inside the palace were equally as stunned. When Devouring Devil and the others emerged from the palace, they noticed the Dragon Overlord standing in front of the gates! </p>
			<p> He wasn’t the only one! </p>
			<p> The God of Death stood right beside him, and Zhu Chen came right after! </p>
			<p> Behind them was a whole bunch of region masters! </p>
			<p> The three of them actually came with an entourage of region masters! </p>
			<p> What in the world… </p>
			<p> Even the marshals and great generals felt the world spinning around them. </p>
			<p> Glaring at the guard captain beside him, Devouring Devil silently cursed at him. When he made the report earlier, he only said that Lord Dragon was present. He didn’t say anything about the rest. </p>
			<p> In fact, Devouring Devil was wrong. The only person who identified himself was the Dragon Overlord. How would the guard captain recognize the others?! </p>
			<p> The guard captain felt his entire face cramping up as the hair on his body stood on end. </p>
			<p> He had no idea that that was his last day as the guards captain. Devouring Devil had already decided to demote him the moment they got back. </p>
			<p> After looking at the captain, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Waves crashed against his fragile little heart as the young man he was looking at stood before the three supreme overlords! </p>
			<p> What was going on?! </p>
			<p> Who in the world was the kid?! </p>
			<p> He racked his brain to think of every single expert in the Unknown Space whose status was above the three, but he failed to think of any. </p>
			<p> As for the Dazzling Sun Princess and the experts behind her, they were completely overlooked. </p>
			<p> The Devouring Devil ran all the way to the entrance. </p>
			<p> When the Dazzling Sun Princess snapped out of her confusion and wanted to greet Devouring Devil, Devouring Devil cupped his fists and greeted the supreme overlords. “Mo Ren greets Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen! Lords brought so many cultivators over to our celestial empire and we deserve to be punished for not welcoming you properly!” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren was the Devouring Devil’s true name. </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess felt as though a thunderbolt was running through her mind. </p>
			<p> Dragon Overlord! </p>
			<p> God of Death! </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen! </p>
			<p> Weren’t they… </p>
			<p> She saw her other grandfathers cupping their fists as they greeted the supreme overlords. “We greet Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen!” </p>
			<p> Eventually, her father and her uncles bowed to greet members of Huang Xiaolong’s party. </p>
			<p> As for the various generals and marshals, they got to their knees. </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess felt her brain hurting. 𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> She thought that she heard Mo Ren wrongly when he greeted them. </p>
			<p> Now, she realized that they were serious! </p>
			<p> The servants behind her fell to their knees in fright when they saw the generals kneeling. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord looked at Mo Ren and the others and he spoke casually, “This is Lord Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren jumped in fright when he heard how the Dragon Overlord addressed Huang Xiaolong, he knew that the real master was standing before him. </p>
			<p> One could only imagine what type of existence the Dragon Overlord and the others would take as their master. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren cupped his fist and bowed respectfully, “Mo Ren, the second son of the Ferocious Devil, greets Lord Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> He didn’t bow when he met the other supreme overlords, but he chose to do so towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The others quickly did the same. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “There’s no need for such formalities. I came all the way over here with them in order to look for your father. I heard that your older brother, Mo Kun, might know where he is.” </p>
			<p> Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, Mo Ren continued, “Lord, my older brother went to the Devil Abyss. He will only be back next month.” </p>
			<p> “Devil Abyss?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. </p>
			<p> The Devil Abyss was the most dangerous region in the Devil Land. It was no wonder he didn’t come out to welcome them. Also, it was located quite a distance away from the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> “Lord, I got some men to prepare a banquet for you in the palace. Why don’t all of you return to the palace with me and enjoy yourselves while we wait for my older brother to return?” Mo Ren muttered. </p>
			<p> “Alright.” Huang Xiaolong eventually nodded his head. </p>
			<p> That was probably the only thing he could do. After all, one month wasn’t a very long time. </p>
			<p> With Huang Xiaolong’s group following closely behind, Mo Ren entered the palace carefully. </p>
			<p> As the Ice Devil stood at the back of the group, he quickly noticed his daughter’s abnormal behavior. “Ruo’er, why are you standing there? Hurry up and enter the palace with me! If you manage to make a toast to any of the supreme overlords, you will be able to gain a great opportunity!”  </p>
			<p> “If you manage to catch their eye, you’ll benefit a whole lot if they choose to give you a few pointers!” </p>
			<p> One had to know that they were together on the list with the Ferocious Devil! </p>
			<p> Even though the members of the celestial empire were descendants of the Ferocious Devil, they hadn’t met their old ancestor! Much less receive his pointers! </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> “I… I…” The Dazzling Sun Princess started to stutter. Trepidation filled her heart. </p>
			<p> She might not have personally made a move against them, but she definitely behaved inappropriately towards them! </p>
			<p> Moreover, her subordinate called Huang Xiaolong and the rest several ungodly words… </p>
			<p> When the Ice Devil saw the look on his daughter’s face, a bad feeling welled up in his heart. </p>
			<p> “Ruo’er, what’s going on?” </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess looked at him and didn’t know what to say.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3696 – Nameless Devil Mirror&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Why aren’t you saying anything?!” The Ice Devil roared as the uneasiness in his heart grew stronger. </p>
			<p> Jumping in fright, the Dazzling Sun Princess had never seen her father lose his temper! </p>
			<p> “Father, I… I…” </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil glared at the guards who were standing by the entrance and summoned them over. Since she wouldn’t say anything, he would ask them to recount what happened! </p>
			<p> Unable to lie to the Ice Devil, they spoke of everything that happened when the Dazzling Sun Princess returned. </p>
			<p> The blood drained from the Ice Devil’s face the more he heard. Fear and panic settled in his heart as he yelled at her, “You… You… You found a really amazing subordinate… What the f*ck is wrong with him?!” </p>
			<p> With a pout on her face, she yelled in indignation. “They were the ones blocking the entrance! I only sent my men to ask them to retreat respectfully, but they went ahead and killed my subordinate!” </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil sneered with rage and he slapped her across the cheek. “Your subordinate called them peasants! He called them slaves of the empire! You didn’t even ask them to leave quietly and you insulted them before knowing their identities! How is that respectful?!” </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess couldn’t believe that her father had slapped her and tears welled up in her eyes. “So what if he’s the Dragon Overlord?! So what if he’s the God of Death?! How dare you slap me?! When grandpa returns, I’ll tell him everything that happened! I’ll ask him to look for the old ancestor on my behalf!”  </p>
			<p> Anger filled the Ice Devil’s heart and his face turned green with rage. </p>
			<p> His father, Mo Kun, had always been biased towards the Dazzling Sun Princess. He would give her whatever she wanted, but he definitely didn’t expect for her to turn out like this. </p>
			<p> “Men, take her down!” The Ice Devil growled. “Send her to the Ice Palace! No… Send her to the Devil Prison!” </p>
			<p> The Dazzling Sun Princess turned pale. The Ice Palace might be terrifying, but her father wanted to send her to the Devil Prison! </p>
			<p> “You cannot send me to prison! Why are you doing this?! I’ll tell grandpa about this!” The Dazzling Sun Princess screamed. “Please, don’t send me to the Devil Prison, you can’t send me there!” </p>
			<p> “Didn’t you hear what I said?!” The Ice Devil roared when he saw that the guards weren’t moving. </p>
			<p> Hesitating slightly, no one dared to touch the Dazzling Sun Princess. </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil exploded with rage when he saw that the guards were kneeling on the ground as their bodies trembled like leaves in the wind. </p>
			<p> “Didn’t you hear what I said?! All of you deserve to die!” </p>
			<p> … </p>
			<p> When that was going on, Mo Ren had brought Huang Xiaolong and the others into the palace. The entire palace was so intricately crafted that it awed many of them. It was as though they had stepped into the depths of the universe when they entered the main hall. Looking at the jade pillars that propped up the ceiling, they saw that a devil beast was carved into the structures. </p>
			<p> Countless formations stood high above their heads as it emitted dense devil qi. </p>
			<p> The hall might seem intimidating, but the air in there didn’t seem sinister at all. Instead, there was an invisible presence that contained the will of an overlord. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stepped into the grand hall and he felt the overlord’s will coming from the carvings on the pillar. </p>
			<p> The banquet lasted through the night. </p>
			<p> When ity finally ended, Mo Ren tried his best to get Huang Xiaolong to stay. He arranged a separate courtyard for every single one in Huang Xiaolong’s party in the middle of the imperial palace. </p>

			<p> When he was done, he summoned the Ice Devil.  </p>
			<p> “I heard that you sent Ruo’er to the Devil Prison. What’s going on?” Mo Ren asked. </p>
			<p> As she was one of his darling granddaughters, he was a little annoyed that the Ice Devil would send her to the Devil Prison. </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil quickly told him everything that happened. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Mo Ren’s expression changed the moment he heard what transpired. “This lass… Why didn’t you tell me something so important?!” </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil lowered his head and he muttered, “I didn’t dare to disturb you after seeing your interaction with the various lords… From what I see, they don’t seem like they wish to pursue the matter.” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren frowned. “Lord Huang Xiaolong and the others chose to look over it because they didn’t wish to seem petty. They only did it because of Lord Ancestor’s prestige. However, since Ruo’er was the one who was wrong, we have to admit our mistakes! I will personally bring her to apologize to the lords tomorrow morning. We will kneel before them until they pardon us.” </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil gasped in fright. “Second Uncle, are you going to apologize to them too?! This… Is this really needed? I’ll get Ruo’er to kneel before them in apology and we’ll call it at that!” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren shook his head and sighed, “You don’t understand. Lord Ancestor has disappeared for countless years. If we fail to take care of this properly, no one will be able to stop them if their entire group goes on a rampage. Do you think anyone can stop three supreme overlords and someone possibly stronger than all three of them without the old ancestor present?!” </p>
			<p> “We will need to draw on their strength if we wish to resist the Universe First Race. When that happens, we might even need them to protect us!” </p>
			<p> During the banquet, Huang Xiaolong told them about the encounter with the Golden Cymbals King. </p>
			<p> The Ice Devil turned serious and he eventually nodded his head. </p>
			<p> The very next day, Mo Ren brought the Dazzling Sun Princess along with him to Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard and kneeled before the man. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t push things as he allowed them to get up before pardoning them. He changed the topic to ask about Mo Kun. </p>
			<p> “I contacted my older brother and told him that all of you have come. He’s excited to return to meet the various lords and he’s rushing back as we speak. He should be back in a month.” Mo Ren bowed respectfully. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to make things difficult for them because of the incident with the Dazzling Sun Princess. </p>
			<p> “Lord, if you have nothing else to do, why don’t you remain in the palace?” </p>
			<p> Hesitating slightly, Huang Xiaolong eventually agreed. “Alright.” 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝒐𝙫𝙚𝓵.𝓬𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p> Since they would have to wait for Mo Kun anyway, he didn’t mind staying in the palace. </p>
			<p> “Oh right, are you familiar with the city?” Huang Xiaolong asked.  </p>
			<p> ?! </p>
			<p> “I heard that there’s a devil mirror in the city and I wish to take a look at it.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> Staring at him in a daze, Mo Ren soon broke into laughter. “Of course! When would you like to visit the mirror?” </p>
			<p> “How about now?” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and they left the palace. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t call the others as he strolled down the city with Mo Ren. </p>
			<p> The devil mirror existed in the city since a long time ago. Not even the Ferocious Devil could discover the secret within, and Huang Xiaolong wondered if he could do it. </p>
			<p> When they arrived, there were countless people gathered around the Nameless Devil Mirror. </p>
			<p> “Is it always so crowded?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Yeah, pretty much.” Mo Ren nodded. “In the past, my father said that anyone who can discover the secret behind the mirror will be able to obtain a reward from the empire. It will also belong to anyone who can bring it away.” </p>
			<p> That was the reason behind the massive crowd.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3697 – Offended Someone You Cannot Afford to Offend&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> “Oh? There’s a reward?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “What are you guys giving out as the reward?” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren was slightly embarrassed and he sighed, “It’s a great reward to experts who are half step Universe Gods, but it’s nothing to someone like yourself.” </p>
			<p> However, he still spoke of the reward. As long as one managed to comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror, they would be given twenty universe-level spiritual veins! They could also choose a single special art from the Ferocious Devil’s collection from before he became a supreme overlord. </p>
			<p> That would mean that the techniques they would receive would be from when the Ferocious Devil had less than 20 billion units of combat strength. </p>
			<p> Even though that was the case, it was still a priceless treasure. It was something experts in the Unknown Space dreamed of obtaining. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong heard the rewards, he chuckled in amusement. “If I manage to discover the mysteries behind the mirror, you can’t take away the reward you promised.” </p>
			<p> “Of course! If Lord manages to discover the mystery behind the mirror, we will give you the reward we promised! Even if you gave us ten times the courage, we won’t dare to do anything to it!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong laughed as he continued onwards. </p>
			<p> Even though there were a ton of people, they stepped aside when Huang Xiaolong passed.  </p>
			<p> That wasn’t because they recognized Mo Ren. Instead, a formless pressure around Huang Xiaolong pushed them away. </p>
			<p> As Mo Ren rarely appeared outside, not many people managed to identify him. After all, not even the Dazzling Sun Princess could see him normally. Otherwise, the entire area would break out into an uproar. </p>
			<p> They eventually arrived before the mirror. </p>
			<p> The Nameless Devil Mirror stood in the air quietly. It was a five sided mirror, but it looked like it had eight sides. There were tons of runes inscribed around the mirror but they weren’t grand dao runes. No one could understand what they were. </p>
			<p> It emitted a soft glow as it spun around in the air. 𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p> However, Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover the Wavering Light Prince standing nearby. </p>
			<p> He was standing respectfully behind a middle-aged man, and streaks of light could be seen hovering above his head. </p>
			<p> The Wavering Light Prince saw Huang Xiaolong, and after a short moment of hesitation, he spoke to the middle-aged man. “Dad, that’s the brat who crippled the experts of our race!” </p>
			<p> When they finally saved the experts of the Wavering Light Devil Race, they discovered that they had all been crippled! </p>
			<p> The middle-aged man was the patriarch of the race, Wu Fu. </p>
			<p> Wu Fu’s head turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong as rage flashed through his eyes. “Oh? Is that the little b*stard who dared to cripple our men?!” </p>
			<p> He might be the patriarch of the Wavering Light Devil Race, but their race wasn’t part of the peak-level races. He had no idea who Mo Ren was. Only the old ancestor of the race knew the second strongest expert in the Devil Capital Celestial Empire. </p>
			<p> “That’s him!” Wu Fu waved his hand and spoke to the eminent elders behind him, “Bring him to me.” </p>
			<p> One of the eminent elders replied respectfully before walking towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The Devouring Devil naturally noticed everything that happened and a frown formed on his face. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer when he saw the eminent elder walking towards him. “When we came to your city yesterday, we ran into the Wavering Light Prince and the Heaven Secret Prince. They were fighting pretty intensely and they said some pretty nasty things when they ran into us.” </p>
			<p> “The members of the Wavering Light Devil Race even wanted to beat us up.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong might not have expressed his rage when he spoke about the incident, but Mo Ren felt his heart palpitating in his chest. The hidden meaning behind his words couldn’t be more clear in Mo Ren’s mind! The city wasn’t properly handled if people could mess around so openly! </p>

			<p> If Huang Xiaolong were to look into the matter, the celestial empire was also at fault! </p>
			<p> When he was still thinking about Huang Xiaolong’s words, the eminent elder of the Wavering Light Devil Race arrived. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and he growled, “Our patriarch wishes to see you.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong stopped Mo Ren before he could say anything. </p>
			<p> “Since your patriarch requested to meet me, he can crawl here himself. Tell him to kneel whenever he takes a step.” </p>
			<p> The eminent elder stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. </p>
			<p> Even though he wasn’t loud, everyone standing around heard what he said. </p>
			<p> Wu Fu’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> The eminent elder of the Wavering Light Devil Race frowned. “Brat, are you messing with me?! You’re looking to die!” After he spoke, his hands turned into claws that reached for Huang Xiaolong’s face. “I’ll tear your eyes off their sockets!” </p>
			<p> It was too bad his hand was grabbed by someone else before it could arrive. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren held the eminent elder’s shoulder and a trace of icy light flashed in his eyes. “If you wish to live, do as he says. In fact, you should listen to him if your race wishes to continue its bloodline. Right now, all of you can crawl over, including your patriarch! Kowtow till Lord Huang Xiaolong is satisfied!” </p>
			<p> Mo Ren wasn't someone who wanted to watch the world burn. He had good intentions as he gave the Wavering Light Devil Race a way out. </p>
			<p> However, the eminent elder sneered in their faces. “Who the f*ck do you think you are?! All of you b*stards deserve to die for humiliating my Wavering Light Devil Race!” </p>
			<p> After he spoke, a punch came flying towards Mo Ren. </p>
			<p> As a God of Creation at the small completion stage, his punch wasn’t weak. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren’s expression turned cold and he slapped the eminent elder once. </p>
			<p> In an instant, the man exploded into countless pieces.  </p>
			<p> Mo Ren’s combat strength might not have surpassed the 20 billion mark, but he was an existence comparable to the Yin Reversal King! How could the eminent elder survive a single slap from him?! </p>
			<p> “What?!” </p>
			<p> The experts standing around gasped in fright when they saw how easily the eminent elder was killed. </p>
			<p> Wu Fu’s expression changed drastically. </p>
			<p> Wu Fu was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he could see how terrifying Mo Ren’s strength was from the slap he gave the eminent elder! </p>
			<p> He knew that Mo Ren was an existence who had reached the peak of the God of Creation Realm! </p>
			<p> Staring at Mo Ren, he stuttered, “Who… Who are you?” He could see that Mo Ren wasn’t Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate, but he had no idea what their relationship was. </p>
			<p> “That’s not important. All you need to know is that you offended someone you cannot afford to offend. If you kneel and apologize to Lord Huang Xiaolong right now, you might be able to save yourself.” </p>
			<p> Lord Huang Xiaolong?! </p>
			<p> He turned to look at the young man standing beside Mo Ren.</p>

			</title>
			<p> No matter how hard Wu Fu racked his brains, he couldn’t remember an expert in the Unknown Space called Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong was pretty strong. He should be a pretty famous figure in the Unknown Space, and he should have heard of Huang Xiaolong’s name! However, that wasn’t the case! </p>
			<p> Mo Ren’s expression sank and he growled, “Why are you still standing there?!” </p>
			<p> As the patriarch of a race, no one dared to speak to him with such disrespect. Moreover, he didn’t recognize Mo Ren. “Who do you think you are to order me around?!” </p>
			<p> Whatever the case, he knew that he couldn’t afford to fight Mo Ren. Waving his hand, he ordered the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race, “Let’s go!” </p>
			<p> A ray of cold light flashed through Mo Ren’s eyes. Right before he could take care of them, Huang Xiaolong stopped him. “It’s alright. We’ll deal with this after we get back.” </p>
			<p> If Mo Ren attacked, they would have to deal with a lot more random matters. </p>
			<p> He was there for the Nameless Devil Mirror. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren eventually nodded and he stood behind Huang Xiaolong silently.  </p>
			<p> Even though the Wavering Light Devil Race was there to mess around, Huang Xiaolong’s mood wasn’t dampened in the slightest. </p>
			<p> He looked at the mirror and he discovered that it looked exactly like any other mirror. However, something changed when he looked at it for a long time. Weird visions appeared in his eyes. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong paused for a second as he closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, he saw the same visions. </p>
			<p> There was no way he could be mistaken! </p>
			<p> After watching it for some time, he closed his eyes only to discover that the image had appeared in his mind. </p>
			<p> The image was too blurry and he couldn’t make out anything specific. </p>
			<p> After some time, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes to observe the mirror. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before another image appeared. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren stood beside Huang Xiaolong and he noticed that Huang Xiaolong would close his eyes occasionally. A confused expression soon appeared on his face. </p>
			<p> No matter how he tried to observe the mirror, he couldn’t make out anything! </p>
			<p> There was nothing special on the mirror, and the only thing special about it was that it was floating in mid air! </p>
			<p> Mo Ren wasn’t the only one. No one else could see anything in the mirror. No matter who it was, the images didn’t appear no matter how hard they looked. </p>
			<p> Just like that, Huang Xiaolong spent an entire day. </p>
			<p> After so long, the images finally started to turn a little clearer. </p>
			<p> In the past, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see anything in the image. However, he finally understood what it held after an entire day of comprehension. </p>
			<p> The image seemed to depict something in the Thirteen Universes. </p>
			<p> Of course, he wasn’t able to see the entire image properly. 𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝓷𝓸𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> As night fell, the image turned completely dark and Huang Xiaolong could no longer see the half blurry image. </p>
			<p> No matter how hard he tried, nothing happened. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong could only choose to give up and return to the palace. </p>
			<p> When he did, he entered his courtyard to think about the image that he saw in the mirror.  </p>
			<p> He could feel that there was something special about the image. </p>
			<p> It seemed to contain a secret of the Thirteen Universes. </p>
			<p> As for Mo Ren, he sent down an order to summon Wu Xin, the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race, to enter the palace. In his summons, Wu Xin was to bring Wu Fu and the Wavering Light Prince along. </p>
			<p> When the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race saw the messenger from the imperial palace, he was shocked. </p>
			<p> “Lord… Lord Mo Ren requested my presence?!” Wu Xin couldn't believe his ears. </p>
			<p> He might be the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race, but their race was too weak to catch the eye of the celestial empire. </p>
			<p> The envoy sent by the celestial empire was an official in the imperial palace, and he replied, “That’s right. Please enter the palace with me in order to not keep Lord Mo Ren waiting. Lord Mo Ren has also requested for you to bring Wu Fu and Wu He.” </p>
			<p> Wu Xin felt that something bad was going to happen when he heard what the official said. </p>
			<p> Mo Ren’s summons might make sense if he was to go alone. However, now that he wanted to see Wu Fu and Wu He, something might go wrong. </p>
			<p> He couldn’t understand why Mo Ren would want to meet them! </p>
			<p> “Why would Lord Mo Ren want to meet them?” Wu Xin asked cautiously while handing over a spatial ring. </p>
			<p> After accepting it, the official remained impassive. “I have no idea. Why would a subordinate like myself know what Lord Mo Ren thinks?” </p>
			<p> “You’ll know when you meet him later.” </p>
			<p> Wu Xin suppressed the worry in his heart and he chuckled, “Right…” </p>
			<p> Soon after, Wu Fu and Wu He were summoned. </p>
			<p> “Lord Father, why would Lord Mo Ren ask for us?” Wu Fu asked. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin’s expression was dark as he growled, “Did you clash with a prince or princess of the royal family?!” </p>
			<p> Wu Fu thought of what happened recently and he frowned. “No, we didn’t.” </p>
			<p> Wu Xin’s frown became deeper. Even if they messed with a prince or princess of the celestial empire, Lord Mo Ren wouldn’t look for them personally! </p>
			<p> When they were thinking hard about the reason behind the summon, they entered the main hall. </p>
			<p> That was the first time they were entering the imperial palace, and they found it hard to breathe when faced with the suffocating aura coming from the pillars.  </p>
			<p> They lowered their heads the moment they entered. </p>
			<p> “You should be curious as to the reason behind my summons.” Mo Ren said as he sat on the throne. “Raise your heads and look at me.” </p>
			<p> The three of them slowly raised their heads when they heard him. </p>
			<p> The instant they saw his face, Wu Fu and Wu He felt a bomb going off in their minds. They felt as though the world was turning dark around them. </p>
			<p> Wu Xin felt his heart coming to a stop when he saw their reactions. </p>
			<p> “What’s wrong? Don’t you recognize me?” Mo Ren growled. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on FreeWebNovel.com. </p>
			<p> “We… We do…” Wu Fu stuttered and Wu He felt his legs going soft. </p>
			<p> “Who do you think I am?” A snort left Mo Ren’s lips. </p>
			<p> Wu Fu fell to his knees and started kowtowing profusely. “Lord… Lord Mo Ren, we didn’t know that it’s you! We were wrong! Please spare our lives.”</p>

			<p> “Kill you?” Mo Ren chuckled. “Do you think I’ll kill you?” </p>

			<p> If Mo Ren didn’t kill them, their fate would be even worse than death! </p>

			<p> Before dawn broke the next day, Huang Xiaolong left the palace for the mirror. When he arrived, the first ray of sunlight fell onto the lands. </p>

			<p> Shaking his head, the Dragon Overlord sighed, “I have no idea. However, not even Lord Devil managed to understand the mysteries behind the mirror! Can our lord actually discover something?” </p>
			<p> “Yeah..” Zhu Chen muttered at the side. </p>
			<p> Half a month passed in a flash. </p>
			<p> One fine day, Huang Xiaolong stood before the mirror. </p>
			<p> After such a long time, the images became pretty clear in his mind. Even so, there were several parts that still eluded him. </p>
			<p> Moreover, he only managed to see ten thousand images in total. </p>
			<p> He could feel that ten thousand was merely the start. By the time he comprehended the ten thousand images, he would be able to discover the other images. </p>
			<p> The images separated and fused together in his mind. </p>
			<p> Rays of light surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s body. </p>
			<p> The images didn’t depict any special art or the mysteries of the universe. It wasn’t part of the grand dao laws. In fact, it surpassed everything Huang Xiaolong ever knew. </p>
			<p> The more he looked at it, the stranger he felt. He could feel his dao souls transforming. </p>
			<p> The three great worlds in his body also started to change. </p>
			<p> After a month passed, Huang Xiaolong finally understood all ten thousand images. </p>
			<p> They formed a perfect image in his mind. </p>
			<p> All of a sudden, the overlords stood before Huang Xiaolong with a serious face. </p>
			<p> “Lord, something happened. My big brother seems to have gone missing.” Mo Ren explained. </p>
			<p> “What?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked. </p>
			<p> “Yes. He should have returned two days ago. However, I tried contacting him today and failed to get any response. I activated all the power under our command but no one managed to locate him.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned. </p>
			<p> Mo Kun was an expert whose combat strength neared the 20 billion mark. There was no way he would disappear without any reason. </p>
			<p> “What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p> “Could the Universe First Race be behind this?!” The Dragon Overlord muttered. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He thought of the same thing. It seemed as though they were on the same page.  </p>
			<p> If his disappearance was related to the Universe First Race, things might get ugly. </p>
			<p> “If that’s true, my big brother might be in serious trouble. Lords, please save him.” Mo Ren begged. </p>
			<p> “Relax. I won’t allow this to happen under my watch. The most important thing right now is to look for the place where your big brother disappeared.” Huang Xiaolong promised. </p>
			<p> “Many thanks! I will definitely look into the matter!” Mo Ren rejoiced when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. </p>
			<p> Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong turned to the others and he ordered, “Pass down the order! Get everyone in the Unknown Space to take note of the Universe First Race!” </p>
			<p> “Yes, Lord!” </p>
			<p> A moment later, all four of them left Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard and he sank deep into his thoughts. </p>
			<p> Could Mo Kun’s disappearance be related to the Golden Cymbals King?! </p>
			<p> Since he destroyed the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation and fled in the battle against Huang Xiaolong, it was more than likely for him to head over to the Devil Land. </p>
			<p> “Universe First Race…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. It seemed as though he had to break thought as quickly as possible. </p>
			<p> He could feel that he was at the cusp of breaking through. The moment he comprehends all of the images, he would enter the peak of the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> This novel is available on &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot;. </p>
			<p> The next day, Huang Xiaolong continued to look in the mirror. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before a new image appeared. </p>
			<p> The 10002nd image only appeared a long time after the first. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong only managed to see a hundred new images in one day. </p>
			<p> Several days later, Mo Ren looked for Huang Xiaolong and reported Mo Kun’s whereabouts. According to the reports, Mo Kun didn’t leave the Devil Abyss! </p>
			<p> ?! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed with a weird light. “Wouldn’t that mean that he disappeared more than a month ago?” </p>
			<p> “Yes.” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong fell silent for a moment. 𝗳𝐫𝗲𝗲𝐰𝗲𝐛𝐧𝐨𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝐨𝐦</p>
			<p> “Lord, should I get them to check again?” Mo Ren couldn’t help but ask again. </p>
			<p> “There’s no need for that. I’ll personally head over to the Devil Abyss.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> Joy filled Mo Ren’s heart. That was the best case scenario. </p>
			<p> A moment later, Huang Xiaolong called the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and Zhu Chen over. He told them his plan, but rejected their offer to follow him over. If Mo Kun really landed in the hands of the Golden Cymbals King, they wouldn’t be able to do a thing.  </p>
			<p> After leaving behind several instructions, Huang Xiaolong left for the Devil Abyss. </p>
			<p> He could only choose to leave the Nameless Devil Mirror behind. He could use the time to comprehend the previous images to its fullest extent. </p>
			<p> Sitting in the grand formation of the Universe Boat, he closed his eyes to comprehend the images he saw before. </p>
			<p> Several days later, he arrived in the vicinity of the Devil Abyss and stored away his Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Looking at the endless darkness, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before jumping in. </p>
			<p> Even though he knew that it was a trap by the Universe First Race, he had to do it. </p>
			<p> Devil qi filled the air inside the Devil Abyss and they existed since the start of time. Extreme frost filled the qi and Dao Venerables would freeze to death the moment they entered. Only if one managed to comprehend the power of absolute frost would they barely be able to venture within. </p>
			<p> Of course, the devil qi and frosty air was nothing to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Releasing his dao souls, he flew towards the depths of the Devil Abyss. </p>
			<p> Countless devilish creatures filled the abyss, but Huang Xiaolong pushed them all away using the formless grand cosmos energy that revolved around his body.</p>

			</title>
			<p> Other than the devilish creatures, there were countless herbs and treasures lying within. There were even several treasures that couldn’t be found in the outside world! Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t slow down to pick them up. </p>
			<p> As someone who stood at the peak of the world, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t lacking in such treasures. </p>
			<p> After the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the region masters’ surrender, Huang Xiaolong could obtain anything he wanted with a snap of his fingers. He couldn’t obtain universe-level spiritual veins in the past, but with a single order, he could gather every single universe-level spiritual vein in their treasuries. He wouldn’t be able to utilize them all. </p>
			<p> As such, Huang Xiaolong would be able to charge straight through to the 29 billion mark the moment he broke through the barrier to the peak of the grand completion stage. </p>
			<p> As he flew towards the depths of the Devil Abyss to look for Mo Kun, the Devil Land suffered from a massive invasion from the devilish creatures. </p>
			<p> Those were the creatures that lived in the Devil Land, and they were even more terrifying than the vicious beasts in the other lands. Normally, the creatures would remain in their territory without disturbing the humans. Now, they rushed out like a tide as they attacked every single territory populated by the Human Race. </p>
			<p> There were several regions without sufficiently strong experts and they were overwhelmed in an instant. </p>
			<p> The Humans and Devils in the Devil Land were devoured by the creatures. </p>
			<p> As the massacre started, chaos filled the lands.  </p>
			<p> In the Devil Capital Celestial Empire, they were surrounded by devilish creatures in all directions. </p>
			<p> Activating the city protecting formation, every creature who drew near to the city were killed. Despite the resistance, the devilish creatures charged towards the city without caring for their lives. They had one goal and one goal only. They wanted to bring down the city! </p>
			<p> The Devouring Devil, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the others stared at the creatures that filled the skies as a frown formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “They definitely received instructions from someone to start creating havoc in the Unknown Space…” The God of Death growled. “Seems like the Universe First Race is starting to make their move.” </p>
			<p> The Devouring Devil, Mo Ren, sighed, “According to the reports, other celestial empires are suffering from a sudden invasion from the creatress. More than ninety percernt of the territories are currently stuck in a war with the creatures! </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord’s eyes flashed red and he chuckled, “I haven’t flexed my muscles for quite some time…” Turning to look at the God of Death and Zhu Chen, he continued, “Let’s go out and have some fun. We’ll see who kills the most…” </p>
			<p> A grin slowly formed on their faces. </p>
			<p> “Alright!” The God of Death roared with laughter, “We’ll kill to our heart’s content!” </p>
			<p> “Nice!” The Dragon Overlord roared. “When the lord returns, we’ll surprise him!” </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen muttered, “What do you mean? It’s just a little hiccup…” As soon as he spoke, he left the confines of the barrier. </p>
			<p> The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death followed quickly behind. After all, the enemies were too weak. If Zhu Chen got a head start, they could be stronger than him for all he cared. The lead he gained was unlikely to shrink! </p>
			<p> As soon as they arrived outside the barrier, they attacked in unison. </p>
			<p> With a single punch, the Dragon Overlord summoned a myriad of golden dragons. Nothing remained in their way. </p>
			<p> The God of Death sent a giant palm flying through space as it slowly transformed into a massive skull. It tore a giant hole through the group of creatures before disappearing into the horizon. </p>
			<p> Zhu Chen rose into the skies as flames surrounded his body. He seemed to have turned into a giant phoenix as he incinerated every creature nearby. </p>
			<p> The five monster kings appeared one after another as they went on a rampage. </p>
			<p> Every time they attacked, the skies would shatter and the earth would shake. They were obviously much more efficient killing machines than the three. </p>
			<p> The marshals and generals stationed in the city gasped in fright when they saw the scene playing outside the barrier. </p>
			<p> No matter which one of the eight they looked at, they knew that those were existences far beyond their level. Mo Ren’s combat abilities closed in on the 19 billion mark. Even if he ran into Gui Chi or several others, he would be able to put up a fight. Now, he realized that he was as weak as a newborn child before the eight supreme masters outside the barrier. </p>
			<p> Just as they were destroying everything around them happily, a golden scaled arm appeared from the void. </p>
			<p> A quick look at FreeWebNovel.com will leave you more fulfilled. </p>
			<p> There were mysterious runes carved into the arm, and they formed images of a golden qilin! 𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p> The arm swept towards the Dragon Overlord the moment it appeared! </p>
			<p> Bang! </p>
			<p> The instant they collided, a massive blast rocked through the space. </p>
			<p> A golden palm print appeared above the Dragon Overlord as it came crashing down. </p>
			<p> The God of Death and the others yelled, “Be careful!” They didn’t hesitate. They launched their attacks in unison to stop the golden palm. Right before the palm could land on the Dragon Overlord’s head, a supreme dragon appeared to defend him. </p>
			<p> That was the limit of the Dragon Overlord’s strength. It wasn’t something he would use to slay the puny devilish creatures. </p>
			<p> The heavens seemed to lose their color when the explosion occurred. </p>
			<p> Even when the three of them worked together, they were sent flying by the giant palm. </p>
			<p> When they finally found their footing, blood leaked from the side of their lips. </p>
			<p> Everyone in the city sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> The three supreme overlords were sent flying with a single strike!  </p>
			<p> “Golden Qilin King!” The three of them roared as they looked at the void above them. </p>
			<p> A middle-aged man slowly revealed himself. </p>
			<p> He looked extremely sturdy and his body seemed like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment. </p>
			<p> “Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen… We meet again.” The middle-aged man looked at the three and he muttered. Even his eyes dazzled a shiny gold. </p>
			<p> The person who came was the Golden Qilin King, one of the thirteen kings of the Universe First Race! </p>
			<p> He was slightly stronger than the Golden Cymbals King when it came to combat abilities! </p>
			<p> The Golden Cymbals King has already surpassed 27 billion units in combat strength, and one could only imagine how strong the Golden Qilin King was! </p>
			<p> The three of them felt an uneasy feeling welling up in their chest when they looked at the Golden Qilin King. </p>
			<p> Casually looking at the five monster kings, the Golden Qiling King harrumphed, “Looks like Huang Xiaolong isn’t all talk… He even managed to subdue the five monster kings of the Naihe Bridge.” </p>
			<p> “It’s too bad he didn’t bring the Ghost Devil King along!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3701: Huang Xiaolong in Danger</p>
			</title>
			<p>The five monster kings gathered together and stood behind the Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen. </p>
			<p>The Blood Tentacles King sneered, “Even without the Ghost Devil King, we’re strong enough to fight against you.” The blood qi around his body soared into the skies and turned into an ocean.</p>
			<p>It was stopped by a formless pressure before it could swallow the Golden Qilin King.</p>
			<p>With a smile on his face, the Golden Qilin King waved his hand. He shattered the sea of blood, causing the Blood Tentacles King to retreat slightly.</p>
			<p>The faces of the four other monster kings changed slightly.</p>
			<p>The Golden Qilin King mocked, “You wish to fight against me?! With you losers?” </p>
			<p>If the Ghost Devil King came, his life might be threatened. However, there was nothing he was afraid of now. Naturally, he didn’t care about the Dragon Overlord and the others.</p>
			<p>Zhu Chen shattered his transmission symbol sneakily, but it was still noticed by the Golden Qilin King.</p>
			<p>With a sneer on his lips, he continued, “Humph, don’t even think of calling Huang Xiaolong back here to help you. He’s in a much more dangerous situation than you guys. He won’t make it back.” </p>
			<p>Their faces changed instantly.</p>
			<p>“Did you draw Lord Huang Xiaolong over to the Devil Abyss on purpose?!” The Dragon Overlord’s face sank.</p>
			<p>“Looks like you’re not stupid. That’s right. We captured Mo Kun in order to draw him over! We’ll deal with him with the power of the Devil Abyss!”</p>
			<p>The hearts of everyone in the city sank.</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil and Green Ghost were missing, and Huang Xiaolong was the only hope left for the Unknown Space. If anything were to happen to him, the Unknown Space would be thrown into chaos!</p>
			<p>“There’s no need to worry. Huang Xiaolong will follow you in the afterlife.” The Golden Qilin King roared with laughter.</p>
			<p>The Universe First Race didn’t plan to deal with the Unknown Space so quickly. However, Huang Xiaolong’s appearance shattered their plans. They felt a sense of danger coming from the kid, and they decided to get rid of him before anything bad happened.</p>
			<p>After all, their plan to destroy the Thirteen Universes a second time was threatened by Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>When the eight of them were still stuck in a daze, the Golden Qilin King moved. He appeared before them in an instant as his fists shot out.</p>
			<p>Golden fists appeared in the skies as they slammed downwards. It was much stronger than his strike before!</p>
			<p>Previously, he was hiding some of his strength. Now that there was nothing else for him to worry about, he could go all out!</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the five monster kings didn’t dare to hold back. They pushed themselves to their limit as they tried to defend themselves. 𝒇𝒓𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>As none of them had their universe treasures, their combat abilities were slightly affected.</p>
			<p>Once again, they were sent flying.</p>
			<p>The experts in the city couldn’t help but panic when they saw their strongest experts being beaten back. Even so, they couldn’t do anything to assist them! After all, the shockwaves of the battle would be more than enough to seriously injure someone like Mo Ren! </p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, should we try to contact the old ancestor?” one of the marshals in the celestial empire whispered.</p>
			<p>Mo Ren shook his head and sighed. “I tried that a moment ago. I can’t reach him.” </p>
			<p>“Do you think that Lord Huang Xiaolong has already been…” </p>
			<p>Mo Ren remained quiet. Since the Golden Qilin King had spoken, none of them were confident that Huang Xiaolong would be able to retreat unscathed.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>When that went down, Huang Xiaolong casually flew through the Devil Abyss. With his heart trembling slightly, his body flashed, and he dodged a strike that came from nowhere. A sword light that struck the place he was once standing in turned the entire area into chaos space.</p>
			<p>The sword light was formless and Huang Xiaolong knew that the only thing he could do was to dodge.</p>
			<p>A sneer came from the void.</p>
			<p>“Who would have thought that you would be so hard to deal with?” </p>
			<p>The void seemed to come from the Golden Cymbals King.</p>
			<p>As soon as his voice fell, his figure appeared from within the void. He wasn’t the only one. There was another youngster beside him holding a jet-black sword. There was a sinister smile on his face.</p>
			<p>Looking at the youngster beside the Golden Cymbals King, Huang Xiaolong felt his heart sinking. “Heaven Devouring King!” </p>
			<p>Out of the thirteen kings, the Golden Cymbals King ranked sixth, the Golden Qilin King ranked fifth, and the Heaven Devouring King ranked even higher than them!</p>
			<p>He was the fourth-strongest king!</p>
			<p>He was a monster whose combat abilities closed in on the 29 billion mark! </p>
			<p>Moreover, his sword dao was much stronger than Jian Wushuang!</p>
			<p>The Heaven Devouring King looked at Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “Young man, there’s no need to be afraid. I’ve always been a very nice man. As long as you hand over your universe treasures, I’ll allow you to bring up a request. I’ll fulfill anything you desire as long as it’s within my power!” </p>
			<p>“Alright. I’ll hand them over. My request for you is to kill yourself!” Huang Xiaolong sneered.</p>
			<p>The faces of the two kings sank. “Brat, who do you think you’re talking to?!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snorted in response.</p>
			<p>However, the Heaven Devouring King soon revealed another smile. “Well, you’ll know what happens when you try to mess with me.” The black sword in his hand disappeared the moment he spoke. Two black swords appeared behind him, and they soon split into four. In an instant, several billion swords hovered behind him. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree and miniature star dragons appeared in the skies above. They formed a star dragon world with him as its core.</p>
			<p>The black swords behind the Heaven Devouring King shot towards Huang Xiaolong in an instant as they slammed against the Star Dragon World.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>The Star Dragon World that stood strong against the assault started to tremble, but a hole was soon punched through its surface!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3702 – Fighting For His Life&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> The moment the hole appeared, a torrent of swords shot towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, the entire world was filled with black swords. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. </p>
			<p> No one had ever been able to punch a hole through the defenses of the Star Dragon Divine Tree before! </p>
			<p> It was evident that the other party’s strength far exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s own! </p>
			<p> A snort left the Heaven Devouring King’s lips when he saw the expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you’re unbeatable because of your Star Dragon Divine Tree?! You’re too naive!” </p>
			<p> “The Star Dragon Divine Tree might be strong, but you’re too weak!” </p>
			<p> “Your cultivation is far from being able to stand against me!” </p>
			<p> As the words left his lips, the black swords in the skies flew towards Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p> Flames covered his body as Huang Xiaolong’s expression sank. </p>
			<p> The four Universe Origin Fires emerged as the divine beasts blocked off the black swords soaring towards his head. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. He stepped on the Yin Yang Flame Wheel and he rushed towards the Heaven Devouring King at a shocking speed! Even though he hadn’t reached the peak of the grand completion stage, his speed was terrifying! With the assistance of the Yin Yang Flame Wheel, he arrived in an instant. </p>
			<p> The Three Gods Halberd and Reversal Sword struck at the Heaven Devouring King’s chest. </p>
			<p> Right before they could touch the man, he waved his hand and the golden swords appeared to stop the weapons. </p>
			<p> Clang! </p>
			<p> A resounding blast filled the Devil Abyss. </p>
			<p> Not only did Huang Xiaolong fail to break through the curtain of black swords, but he was forced to retreat. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King flicked his finger once and the rain of black swords continued. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong dodged left and right in order to avoid the deadly attacks. </p>
			<p> Even with the Golden Sun Circlets, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Yin Yang Flame Wheels, Three Gods Halberd, Reversal Sword, and the four Universe Origin Fires, he was still struck once by a single strand of sword qi. Blood spurted from his wound. </p>
			<p> Of course, it healed in an instant. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King sneered, “The Star Dragon Divine Tree really deserves its name as the second-ranked universe treasure. Its regeneration ability is insanely powerful…” </p>
			<p> The sword qi he summoned was no ordinary sword qi. The wound would continue to rot if one was struck by the sword qi. Despite that, the star dragon qi allowed Huang Xiaolong to recover completely. One could easily see how terrifying the star dragon qi was. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would grab all their weapons… with the Blade of Death you’re hiding, you should have seven universe treasures, right?” The Golden Cymbals King roared with laughter. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King continued, “Alright. We won’t have to look for them one by one.” </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, hand them over! No matter how much you struggle, it’s useless!” </p>
			<p> “I laid down the Star Gathering Sword Formation around half the Devil Abyss. You won’t be able to escape unless you defeat me! Do you really think that’s going to happen?”  </p>
			<p> A smug expression could be seen on the Heaven Devouring King’s face. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong frowned in response. </p>
			<p> During the exchange earlier, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Heaven Devouring King’s strength had far exceeded his expectations. Even with all the treasures he had, he couldn’t bridge the gap between their strength. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King’s combat strength neared the 29 billion mark. As a half-step Universe God, the Heaven Devouring King’s cultivation was far higher than Huang Xiaolong’s! His grand cosmos energy hadn’t broken through the 27 billion mark and he was only at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! The difference between them was far too large. </p>
			<p> Other than the Heaven Devouring King, the Golden Cymbals King was being an annoying b*stard who was waiting at the side. </p>
			<p> Even that annoying golden-robed weirdo posed a threat to him! </p>
			<p> Read the most updated version of this novel and other amazing translated novels from the original source at &quot;FreeWebNovel.com&quot; </p>
			<p> Was he really going to have to expose the Universe Boat?! 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝒃𝙣𝓸𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p> The moment he used it, the Black Nether King might personally hunt him down! </p>
			<p> Even with the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to hold up against the Black Nether King. </p>
			<p> He might be able to gain the assistance of the Ferocious Devil, but that wouldn’t be enough! </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King sneered when he saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Since you’re unwilling to hand them over, I’ll show you what despair feels like!” Black light revolved around his body after he spoke. Every time it grew a little wider, the entire world around them would turn a little darker. </p>
			<p> The darkness around his body grew to fill the space within the Devil Abyss. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s expression changed slightly. </p>
			<p> He knew that that was the Heaven Devouring King’s devouring ability. </p>
			<p> His true form was a Heaven Devouring Beast that was born with the creation of the Thirteen Universes. He was the only creature of his race! </p>
			<p> He had the ability to devour the entire Devil Land by himself! </p>
			<p> That was how terrifying his ability was!  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s Yin Yang Flame Wheel moved once again as he charged towards the Heaven Devouring King. The weapons shot out at the man as the Blade of Death appeared to stab at his eye. </p>
			<p> It was completely useless. </p>
			<p> Before he could arrive a hundred feet away from the Heaven Devouring King, he was sent flying. </p>
			<p> The formless black energy around the Heaven Devouring King stopped anyone from coming close. </p>
			<p> As the dark light that filled the Devil Abyss gathered together, they quickly tried to swallow Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> He could only retreat with haste. </p>
			<p> The only way someone could resist the devouring power was if they were stronger than the Heaven Devouring King! Otherwise, not even their bones would remain. </p>
			<p> When he retreated, the black light surged after him. It moved as quickly as Huang Xiaolong, and he eventually arrived at the edge of the Star Gathering Sword Formation. </p>
			<p> The power of the formation stopped Huang Xiaolong from going any further. </p>
			<p> Watching the black light approach, Huang Xiaolong was about to summon the Universe Boat. Luckily for him, a giant arm tore through the formation to smash at the sea of darkness.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3703: Pretty Fast</p>
			</title>
			<p>The giant arm tore through the dark light like it was nothing!</p>
			<p>It continued on its way towards the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King.</p>
			<p>Before they could react, it arrived right above their heads.</p>
			<p>When the two kings felt the terrifying power coming from the arm, their expressions changed.</p>
			<p>They seemed to have thought of the same person as they yelled in unison, “Ferocious Devil!”</p>
			<p>Even though they were surprised, the Heaven Devouring King acted immediately. The black swords that filled the area gathered together and emitted twice as much power compared to the time he was attacking Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The Golden Cymbals King didn’t hold back either. He summoned his golden cymbals and sent them flying towards the crack in space.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>The tear in space that came from the strength of the arm slammed into the river of black swords ripping it apart. </p>
			<p>It was like a bubble that popped in the air above them.</p>
			<p>The golden cymbals that arrived were sent flying.</p>
			<p>Seeing as their defenses were useless, they could only try again before the arm arrived.</p>
			<p>With their heaven-shaking strength, the entire Devil Abyss trembled when they unleashed their true power.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>After countless strikes, they finally stopped the arm that was crashing down on them.</p>
			<p>Even so, they were forced to retreat countless steps back. It was especially so for the Golden Cymbals King. He nearly fell, and he was forced into an extremely sorry state.</p>
			<p>The Heaven Devouring King fared slightly better. His arms went completely numb at the end of it.</p>
			<p>“Let’s go!” The Heaven Devouring King didn’t hesitate. He tore through the skies with the Golden Cymbals King and left the confines of the Star Gathering Sword Formation. The moment he did, the protective formation turned into countless layers of sword qi that protected them from further attacks.</p>
			<p>Watching the two of them get away, a cold snort boomed through the air. A giant palm appeared once again to stop them from leaving.</p>
			<p>The weight of a million mountains came crashing down on them.</p>
			<p>Even with the formation to protect them, they could feel the universe-destroying might coming towards them.</p>
			<p>Roaring with all his might, layers of black light surrounded the Heaven Devouring King.</p>
			<p>The golden cloth that the Golden Cymbals King used against Huang Xiaolong appeared once again to turn the area around him into a sea of gold. As waves that were thousands of miles tall rose, they charged at the giant palm.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>Their attacks slammed into the giant palm as rays of light filled the abyss.</p>
			<p>The giant palm shattered the dark light and golden sea in an instant.</p>
			<p>The two kings were sent flying as they coughed up mouthfuls of blood.</p>
			<p>An expression of fright appeared on their faces.</p>
			<p>It had only been several years since they last met. How did the Ferocious Devil become so damn strong?!</p>
			<p>They looked at each other before retrieving a talisman. They didn’t hesitate to crush it and a weird light surrounded them before anyone could react. They disappeared without a trace, as though they had never existed in the first place. They left the Unknown Space using some sort of special method.</p>
			<p>“Humph… They’re pretty fast when it comes to running away…” A middle-aged man appeared in the Devil Abyss. There was an air of elegance around him and his eyes shone like stars. His eyebrows were sharp like swords but they were completely white in color.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock. Was he the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil?!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong flew towards him and cupped his fists respectfully. “Many thanks to fellow cultivator for saving my life.”</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil chuckled in amusement and stared at Huang Xiaolong with a deep gaze, “Even if I didn’t do anything, you would be able to escape from his formation…”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback, but he laughed in response. “Even so, it won’t be easy for me to leave the Devil Abyss. I’ll have to thank you no matter what.”</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil no longer continued the topic. He looked in the direction they fled and sighed, “Looks like the Black Nether King is about to fully recover.”</p>
			<p>“The Black Nether King was injured?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.</p>
			<p>The Black Nether King was the strongest expert among the thirteen kings of the Universe First Race. Who in the world had the ability to harm him?!</p>
			<p>Probably not even the Ferocious Devil could injure the man.</p>
			<p>“When the Black Nether King harvested the lives of the Thirteen Universes in the past in an attempt to break through to the Universe God Realm, he failed and suffered a serious backlash from the universes. He has been in seclusion all this time in order to treat his injuries. That’s the reason behind the Universe First Race’s indifference to our presence.”</p>
			<p>So that was the case…</p>
			<p>Now that the Black Nether King was about to fully recover, the Universe First Race planned to deal with the Unknown Space to prevent any unknown factors from interrupting their master plan. The appearance of the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King was the greatest sign of that.</p>
			<p>“We don’t have much time left.” The Ferocious Devil sighed. His worry was evident.</p>
			<p>The moment the Black Nether King recovered, the next person to show up in the Unknown Space to take care of things might be the man himself.</p>
			<p>If he really came, not even the Ferocious Devil would be able to stop him.</p>
			<p>The Unknown Space would fall in an instant!</p>
			<p>Since the Black Nether King wanted to try to break through again, the first group of people he would slaughter would be the members of the Unknown Space. After all, they were the only survivors during the destruction previously.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.</p>
			<p>“What about Mo Kun?” Huang Xiaolong spoke after some time.</p>
			<p>“He’s alright.” The Ferocious Devil muttered, “Let’s head back.”</p>
			<p>Leaving the Devil Abyss, they left for the city.</p>
			<p>As soon as they returned, Huang Xiaolong learned of the invasion by the devilish creatures. The Golden Qilin King had also left, but the eight experts suffered quite a bit of injuries. The appearance of the Green Ghost saved them all. </p>
			<p>“We were fighting toe to toe with the Golden Qilin King after Lord Ghost appeared, but he left suddenly,” The Dragon Overlord reported.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong knew exactly why. He probably received the news that the Ferocious Devil had appeared in the Devil Abyss to save Huang Xiaolong. There was no point in dragging on the battle as they wouldn’t be able to achieve anything with the Ferocious Devil’s arrival.</p>
			<p>After the kings left, the experts of Devil Land gathered together to push the devilish creatures back.𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil’s return caused Devil Land to cheer wildly.</p>
			<p>In the main palace, there was a great feast arranged to welcome the Ferocious Devil back to his territory.</p>
			<p>After the banquet, Huang Xiaolong returned to his old routine of comprehending the images in the Devil Mirror.</p>
			<p>The sense of urgency in his heart burned even stronger after meeting the Heaven Devouring King. Huang Xiaolong knew that he needed to break through before anything else.</p>
			<p>A year later, Huang Xiaolong finally understood the second set of ten thousand images.</p>
			<p>Then came the third set and fourth…</p>
			<p>After several hundred years, Huang Xiaolong comprehended a hundred and thirty thousand images and the Nameless Devil Mirror started to shine with a terrifying light. It rose from its original spot and fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hand.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3704: Secret of the Nameless Devil Mirror</p>
			</title>
			<p>When it landed on his hand, everyone in the surrounding stared at him in shock.𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil who received the news in the imperial palace stared at the messenger for quite some time in shock.</p>
			<p>He knew that Huang Xiaolong had been trying to comprehend the secrets regarding the mirror, but he felt that it wasn’t possible.</p>
			<p>Now, the kid actually brought away the Nameless Devil Mirror!</p>
			<p>Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong managed to do what he couldn’t?</p>
			<p>“Did Huang Xiaolong comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror?” The Green Ghost asked.</p>
			<p>He tried to understand the mysteries behind the mirror, but like the Ferocious Devil, he didn’t understand a thing!</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil hesitated for a moment and muttered, “Probably…”</p>
			<p>He wasn’t too sure what was going on. </p>
			<p>However, if Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain the mirror, he probably understood the secrets behind it.</p>
			<p>A light flashed in The Green Ghost’s eyes.</p>
			<p>He might not know what the Nameless Devil Mirror represented, but he knew that it wasn’t ordinary! In fact, it should be an extremely special existence!</p>
			<p>He even thought that he would be able to comprehend the mysteries of the universe the moment he understood the secrets behind the mirror!</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil chuckled softly when he noticed the look in The Green Ghost’s eyes. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t as simple as he seems. Even I might not be able to suppress him if I made a move personally, much less you…”</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost gasped in fright. “What?!” </p>
			<p>He clearly didn’t believe that the Ferocious Devil wasn’t enough to suppress Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil stood up and looked in the direction where the mirror once was. “He has a lot of secrets on him. Not even I can see through him. In the Thirteen Universes we lived in previously, there were only two people who gave me the same feeling.”</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost fell silent.</p>
			<p>He knew exactly what the Ferocious Devil meant.</p>
			<p>“In fact, it’s a good thing that he managed to understand the secrets behind the mirror. After all, we’re facing the same enemy!”</p>
			<p>That was the reason behind the Ferocious Devil’s generosity in handing over the mirror to the city. He wanted to find a powerful ally to fight against the Universe First Race!</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost sucked in a cold breath and suppressed his greedy desires. “Lord Devil is right. I didn’t think things through.” </p>
			<p>“Not to worry. You were merely deluded for a moment.” Chuckling slightly, the Ferocious Devil continued, “Let’s go. Huang Xiaolong is back. Let’s congratulate him.”</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>As the silvery moonlight fell on the lands, Huang Xiaolong sat in the middle of the second layer of formations on the Universe Boat and absorbed an endless amount of universe source qi.</p>
			<p>There was an object floating in the air above him, and it was precisely the Nameless Devil Mirror he obtained that morning.</p>
			<p>Every time it turned a single round above his head, the images that Huang Xiaolong comprehended would appear around him.</p>
			<p>The images became clearer and clearer, as though they were corporeal.</p>
			<p>The one hundred thirty thousand images depicted the changes of the Thirteen Universes since the start of time.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the universes were created.</p>
			<p>As the images of the thirteen universes revolved around him, they were like thirteen balls of light that emitted multi-colored lights.</p>
			<p>The Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, Three Gods Halberd, Golden Sun Circlet, Blade of Death, and the Yin Yang Flame Wheels emerged from his body without warning. They started to spin around with the universes.</p>
			<p>The three great worlds in his body appeared above his head, and they mirrored the movement of the universes.</p>
			<p>As time trickled on, the grand cosmos energy produced by his three great worlds started to transform. They turned completely golden in color and so did the three great worlds.</p>
			<p>Hundreds of thousands of years passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>On one fateful day, the transformation was complete and the three great worlds produced by Huang Xiaolong, including the grand cosmos energy they produced, became completely golden in color.</p>
			<p>Buzz…</p>
			<p>The sounds of shattering could be heard as something in Huang Xiaolong seemed to split apart.</p>
			<p>His body started to turn gold in color.</p>
			<p>A terrifying might emerged from his body and the pressure collided with the might of the universe that governed the lands. His grand cosmos energy expanded like the sea and it soon filled every crevice of the second layer of restrictions. </p>
			<p>Several years later…</p>
			<p>The pressure that came from Huang Xiaolong’s body receded like a tide and the grand cosmos energy slowly disappeared. He opened his eyes slowly as he finally broke through to the peak of the grand completion stage!</p>
			<p>In the past, he was stuck at the limit of the grand completion stage. Now, his grand cosmos energy finally crossed the 27 billion mark!</p>
			<p>He stretched his hand out slightly and the devil mirror fell onto it. Looking at the mirror in his hand, Huang Xiaolong fell deep into his thoughts. Even though he had no idea what the mirror was, he knew that it was an object that existed long before the creation of the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>That was because it recorded the formation of the universes!</p>
			<p>The Nameless Devil Mirror might not be a universe treasure, but it was definitely a treasure that surpassed that grade! Universe treasures were only born by the universes long after the mirror came into existence.</p>
			<p>It was even older than the Universe Boat!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong might be a little hesitant when breaking through to the Universe God Realm in the past. However, he gained a huge boost in confidence now that he obtained the mirror.</p>
			<p>He comprehended the mysteries of the universe when he was cultivating, but he knew that it was merely the tip of the iceberg. When he truly comprehended the secret and mysteries of the universe, he would finally turn into a Universe God!</p>
			<p>As the strongest universe treasure, the Universe Boat also contained the intricacies of the universe. However, it only contained the secret of the First Universe! The Nameless Devil Mirror contained the secret of all thirteen!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3705: Laying Down the Extermination Formation</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong not only managed to comprehend the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes and break through to the peak of the grand completion stage. He also managed to understand a supreme art! When he finally processed the technique in his mind, he dubbed it the Universe Transformation Art!</p>
			<p>The Universe Transformation Art consisted of the transformation and formation of all Thirteen Universes!</p>
			<p>Even so, Huang Xiaolong only scraped the tip of the iceberg. The Universe Transformation Art he understood wasn’t complete!</p>
			<p>He was confident that in time, he would be able to perfect the technique as his understanding of the mysteries of the universe became more solid!</p>
			<p>Moreover, he discovered that the Universe Transformation Art could be used when he circulated all three great worlds.</p>
			<p>Regaining his calm, Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave the Universe Boat immediately. Instead, he threw even more spiritual veins into the eye of the formation to produce universe source qi. He absorbed the qi as he circulated the technique.</p>
			<p>As he had barely broken through to the peak of the grand completion stage, his foundation wasn’t solid enough. He planned to refine the universe source qi to slowly increase his power!</p>
			<p>Even more time passed. This time, several hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong frowned as he realized that his strength wasn’t rising as quickly as before. </p>
			<p>In the past, he would be able to increase his grand cosmos energy by several hundred million units in a hundred thousand years. Now, he only managed to increase it by a hundred million units in the same amount of time!</p>
			<p>The higher his cultivation level went, the slower it became!</p>
			<p>He also discovered that the speed at which he devoured universe source qi was tens of times faster when he circulated the Universe Transformation Art than when he used his three great arts previously!𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>He could refine several dozen strands of universe source qi in the span of a single day!</p>
			<p>In the past, he only used a few hundred strands of universe-level spiritual qi when cultivating. Now, he used nearly twenty thousand of them!</p>
			<p>Again, several hundred thousand years passed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong eventually opened the third layer of restrictions.</p>
			<p>Cultivating in the third level of restrictions, more than three million years passed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong finally stopped as he looked at the universe source qi in the third layer. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he had no idea how many strands of universe-level spiritual veins he used. Most of them were of the peak and high-grade level and that was a monstrous amount of money.</p>
			<p>He basically used up every single universe-level spiritual vein in the Unknown Space. The treasuries of the supreme overlords had been plundered by him, and he refined everything he could.</p>
			<p>After three million years, he finally broke through to the 29 billion mark.</p>
			<p>Of course, he barely crossed it.</p>
			<p>As for the comprehension of the Nameless Devil Mirror, he managed to understand the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes to the next level. His understanding of the Universe Transformation Art was no longer as rough as it was in the past.</p>
			<p>He understood one-tenth of the secrets behind the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>When he broke into the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm previously, he barely understood anything regarding the mysteries of the universe! Now, he knew a lot more! </p>
			<p>Stepping out from the third layer of restrictions, Huang Xiaolong discovered that he underwent a terrifying change.</p>
			<p>After learning the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes, Huang Xiaolong’s strength reached a whole new level. He was no longer the Huang Xiaolong of the past!</p>
			<p>The instant he appeared, he received a message from the Ferocious Devil. He didn’t even have the time to summon the Dragon Overlord and the others when he received it.</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil didn’t say much in the message. He only said that he wished to discuss matters regarding the Universe First Race with him.</p>
			<p>Stepping into the main hall, Huang Xiaolong saw that the Ferocious Devil wasn’t the only one present. The Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen were all present.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord and the other two quickly approached Huang Xiaolong to welcome him.</p>
			<p>“Lord!” </p>
			<p>A look of amazement flashed through the Ferocious Devil’s eyes when he saw Huang Xiaolong. Out of those present, he was the strongest individual! He was able to discover that Huang Xiaolong was completely different from before!</p>
			<p>“Congratulations Fellow Cultivator Huang for breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage.” The Ferocious Devil cupped his fists and smiled.</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost felt his body trembling when he heard what the Ferocious Devil said.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Overlord and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as surprise flashed in their eyes.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s creation of three great worlds was nothing special to those in the grand hall. The Ferocious Devil and Green Ghost heard of it in the past from Huang Xiaolong himself. Now that he entered the peak of the grand completion stage, wouldn’t it mean that his grand cosmos energy had broken through the 27 billion units mark?</p>
			<p>“Congratulations, Lord!” The Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen laughed excitedly.</p>
			<p>“Congratulations, Lord Huang Xiaolong.” The Green Ghost hesitated for a moment before changing the way he addressed Huang Xiaolong. In the past, he had always addressed Huang Xiaolong as a ‘fellow cultivator’. Now, it seemed as though he had to call Huang Xiaolong properly. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong thanked them as a smile formed on his face. “I was merely lucky when breaking through…”</p>
			<p>Even though the Ferocious Devil could see that Huang Xiaolong had entered the peak of the grand completion stage, he couldn’t see that Huang Xiaolong had already broken through the 29 billion mark!</p>
			<p>With the Universe Transformation Art, Huang Xiaolong could hide his strength easily!</p>
			<p>After he took his seat, the Ferocious Devil spoke about the events that happened in the past millions of years.</p>
			<p>None of the members of the Universe First Race entered the Unknown Space since the battle in the Devil Abyss. However, the Ferocious Devil could feel that the Universe First Race was cooking up something huge.</p>
			<p>“Brother Devil, do you mean to say that the Universe First Race has already been laying down their grand formation to destroy the Thirteen Universes?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “If they complete their formation, they would be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes once again…”</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil nodded slightly as a light flashed in his eyes. “That’s right. The moment they complete the formation, they would be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes for a second time! They will harvest the lives of those there like they are nothing! This time, they won’t allow anyone to escape! Even our Unknown Space will be destroyed in the process!”</p>
			<p>The hearts of everyone in the hall sank.</p>
			<p>“How can we stop them?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>“Even though I managed to discover that they’re laying down the formation, I am unable to discover which one of the thirteen kings is responsible for it…”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3706: Fighting the Ghost Devil King</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Brother Devil, can we stop the creation of the formation if we kill the king behind the Extermination Formation?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil nodded his head and said in a serious voice, “That’s right. Not everyone can lay down the Extermination Formation. In the past, the Black Nether King probably taught one of the kings how to do it.”</p>
			<p>“Wouldn’t that mean that someone other than the Black Nether King is responsible for the formation? Even if we kill him, the Black Nether King will be able to take over!”</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil sighed. “Of course, I know that. However, we can only choose to delay them by killing the other person setting up the formation. If we fail to do anything, the Thirteen Universes will undergo the destruction tribulation. Once it starts, we won’t be able to stop it.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a moment and muttered, “I shall travel over to the Universe First Race to look for the king responsible for the formation…”</p>
			<p>A trace of joy filled the Ferocious Devil’s heart. “That would be for the best. It’s too bad all of us are cursed by the previous destruction tribulation and won’t be able to follow you there…”</p>
			<p>He could only travel over alone.</p>
			<p>“It’s alright. When I arrive in the Universe First Race, I’ll definitely discover the person who laid down the formation. I’ll capture him and bring him back here.”</p>
			<p>A serious expression appeared on the Ferocious Devil’s face. “When you arrive, you have to be careful not to expose your whereabouts…” </p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong had already reached the peak of the grand completion stage, his fate would be sealed if his tracks were exposed.</p>
			<p>“Of course.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</p>
			<p>He knew how important it was to remain untraceable in the territory of the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>Even at his current level, there were at least three experts in the Universe First Race no weaker than him!</p>
			<p>The Black Nether King, White Feather King, and the Star Refining King were experts whose strength he couldn’t underestimate.</p>
			<p>The other two might not be comparable to the Black Nether King, but their combat strength had long since surpassed the 29 billion mark.</p>
			<p>The White Feather King was comparable to the Ferocious Devil and his combat strength had reached the 29.9 billion mark.</p>
			<p>Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about several matters regarding the Universe First Race. The Ferocious Devil didn’t leave anything out as he told Huang Xiaolong everything he knew.</p>
			<p>Half a day passed…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong finally made his decision. “I’ll head to the eighteenth level of hell before going to the Universe First Race. I’ll bring the six monster kings from the Netherworld along with me.”</p>
			<p>“Alright. The Ghost Devil King is pretty strong. He should be a good assistant to bring along.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was shocked. The Ferocious Devil’s evaluation of the Ghost Devil King’s strength should mean something. Whatever the case, he should be stronger than the Huang Xiaolong of the past.</p>
			<p>“When you go over to the Universe First Race, I won’t be able to help you. Here. This is all the help I can give.” The Ferocious Devil handed over a weapon. “Take my Devil Spear.”</p>
			<p>A jet-black spear appeared in the Ferocious Devil’s hand and a terrifying pressure filled the hall.</p>
			<p>That was the Crow Devil Spear that was part of the thirteen universe treasures!</p>
			<p>The Green Ghost paused for a second when he saw what was going on, and he slowly said, “You should bring along my ghost staff too.”</p>
			<p>The moment the staff appeared, ghosts and demons seemed to fill the sky.𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong wanted to reject their offers, but the Ferocious Devil interrupted him before he could say anything else. “The spear isn’t of too much use to me. When you reach my level, it doesn’t matter whether or not you use a universe treasure.” </p>
			<p>“I hope that Lord Huang Xiaolong will be able to use my Ghost Staff when traveling over to their territory…”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony as he took both weapons.</p>
			<p>Now, he had the Universe Boat, the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Three Gods Halbers, Reversal Sword, Golden Sun Circlets, Yin Yang Flame Wheel, Blade of Death, Crow Devil Spear, and Ghost Staff. He gathered a total of ten universe treasures! </p>
			<p>When he obtained the Blood Axe in the Netherworld, he would have eleven of them!</p>
			<p>The remaining two were in the hands of the White Feather King and Star Refining King. Huang Xiaolong was really curious as to the strength he would gain after gathering all thirteen treasures!</p>
			<p>The night passed uneventfully.</p>
			<p>The very next day, Huang Xiaolong left the city.</p>
			<p>As soon as he did, he summoned the Universe Boat and traveled straight towards the Netherworld.</p>
			<p>After opening the third layer of restrictions, the speed of the Universe Boat was much faster than before.</p>
			<p>One month later, he finally arrived in the city. He didn’t bother Yin Qi as he entered the eighteenth level of the Netherworld.</p>
			<p>He went straight towards the Naihe Bridge.</p>
			<p>As the five monster kings followed closely behind him, no creatures dared to pounce.</p>
			<p>Several months later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the end of the bridge.</p>
			<p>Just as he was about to step onto the end of the bridge, a voice boomed in his mind, “Stop right there!”</p>
			<p>The void was cold, and it contained a shocking amount of killing intent.</p>
			<p>Even someone at Huang Xiaolong’s level felt his dao souls trembling slightly.</p>
			<p>Ghost Devil King!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s face turned serious. From what it seemed, the Ghost Devil King should be as strong as the Heaven Devouring King from the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>Looks of terror formed on the faces of the five monster kings.</p>
			<p>“Wait here,” Huang Xiaolong said as he ignored the warning to step onto the end of the bridge.</p>
			<p>The instant he did, a wave of energy came crashing down on him.</p>
			<p>The wave was made with ghost qi and it contained the resentment of countless spirits. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the end of the wave and he didn’t dare to be careless. He sent a palm strike towards the wave and it pierced a massive hole all the way through.</p>
			<p>“Huh?!” The Ghost Devil King was clearly shocked. </p>
			<p>“Ghost Devil King, come out here, and let’s fight!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>As soon as the words left his lips, a giant figure appeared.</p>
			<p>The ghost figure was tens of millions of feet tall, but it didn’t have a corporeal body! It was a mere shadow! Despite that, the ground shook with every step it took.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong circulated the power of all three great worlds as he looked at the Ghost Devil King.</p>
			<p>“Who are you?!” The Ghost Devil King growled as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong.”</p>
			<p>A giant bloody axe appeared in the hands of the Ghost Devil King but he didn’t utter a word. The axe came slashing down on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>With the Three Gods Halberd in hand, Huang Xiaolong welcomed the attack.</p>
			<p>Clang!</p>
			<p>Blood rain splattered all over the ground as the Ghost Devil King took several steps back in retreat.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3707: Meeting Pangu Again</p>
			</title>
			<p>The Ghost Devil King stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.</p>
			<p>He might not have a physical body, but that didn’t affect his strength. His strength was said to be unmatched. Only the Ferocious Devil had the ability to force him back! How can Huang Xiaolong be as strong as the Ferocious Devil?!</p>
			<p>When he was still stuck in a state of shock, flames covered Huang Xiaolong’s body as he summoned the four Universe Origin Fires. The blood qi at the end of the Naihe Bridge was incinerated in an instant.</p>
			<p>With the power of the Universe Origin Fires, the Ghost Devil King retreated once again. However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t let up as he appeared before the Ghost Devil King before stabbing out with the Three Gods Halberd.</p>
			<p>This time, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art. As grand cosmos energy gushed out from his body, the Three Gods Halbers seemed to transform into a streak of light as it shot straight for the Ghost Devil King’s chest.</p>
			<p>The Blood Axe in the Ghost Devil King’s hand slammed into the Three Gods Halberd. Even though he managed to stop the halberd, he was sent flying as the axe soared through the skies to land in some random place.</p>
			<p>With the power of the Universe Transformation Art, Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy became stronger by nearly forty percent! There was no way the Ghost Devil King who hadn’t broken through the 29 billion units mark could stop him!</p>
			<p>After he sent the Ghost Devil King flying, Huang Xiaolong appeared above his head with no hesitation. He was in a rush to head over to the Universe First Race, and he didn’t wish to waste any more time.</p>
			<p>Right before he could say anything, the Ghost Devil King turned into a puff of black gas and flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s body. His speed was shockingly fast, and he was about to fuse with Huang Xiaolong before the man could react. </p>
			<p>The Blood Tentacle King was able to control others by controlling their dao souls and dao heart. The Ghost Devil King possessed an ability stronger than that! Even the Ferocious Devil would be hard-pressed to chase the Ghost Devil King out of his body if he succeeded. </p>
			<p>The instant the Ghost Devil King was about to invade Huang Xiaolong’s body, the Universe Origin Fires activated. It turned into a world of fire and protected Huang Xiaolong’s body from any sinister attacks.</p>
			<p>A miserable scream came from the lips of the Ghost Devil King.</p>
			<p>There was nearly no flame in the universes that could hurt an existence at his level, but it was too bad he was up against the Universe Origin Fires!</p>
			<p>It was a perfect counter to existences like himself!</p>
			<p>Half a day later…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong subdued the Ghost Devil King without much fanfare.</p>
			<p>The Ghost Devil King could have escaped after turning into the black smog. Not even the Ferocious Devil could trap him there if he wanted to leave. However, Huang Xiaolong had both the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the four Universe Origin Fires. With the combination, he managed to stop the Ghost Devil King from running.</p>
			<p>Kneeling before Huang Xiaolong, the Ghost Devil King presented the Blood Axe to Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Finally, he gathered eleven universe treasures.</p>
			<p>Now, there were only those in the hands of the Universe First Race.𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝓿𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain in the Netherworld after he was done. With the six monster kings following behind him, he ran straight for the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>Along the way, he entered the third layer of restrictions of the Universe Boat and refined the Blood Axe.</p>
			<p>As for the Crow Devil Spear and the Ghost Staff, he had long since refined them when he traveled to the Netherworld.</p>
			<p>Several months later, he left the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>The Universe First Race lived in a place called the Universe Vault.</p>
			<p>It was the highest location in the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>Even with the speed of his Universe Boat, he needed countless years in order to arrive.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong remained in the formation as he tried to comprehend the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes from the Nameless Devil Mirror.</p>
			<p>Even though he was no longer able to convert universe source qi, he could still use the source energy that was in the universe. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was much faster than the Ferocious Devil.</p>
			<p>Several years later…</p>
			<p>As he approached the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat away and hid his aura completely. His facial muscles started to constrict and his appearance changed. Huang Xiaolong ensured that not even the Golden Cymbals King would recognize him before stopping.</p>
			<p>Soon after, he started to imitate the aura given off by the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King.</p>
			<p>The Universe First Race gave off a different aura. Even their bodies were different from those of ancient races. As such, he needed to disguise himself completely.</p>
			<p>However hard he tried, he could only imitate ninety percent of their aura.</p>
			<p>He eventually gave up trying.</p>
			<p>It might only be ninety percent, but not even God of Creation Realm experts in the Universe First Race would be able to tell that he wasn’t one of them.</p>
			<p>After entering the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong grabbed several God of Creation Realm experts, and he experimented with changing his aura to become like them.</p>
			<p>When he was finally done, he flew deeper into the Universe Vault.</p>
			<p>Experts of the Universe First Race stood guard near the entrance of the region. Entering would be a serious problem. They might not notice that Huang Xiaolong was not part of them, but existences who guarded the stronghold of a race like that would be existences at the level of Gui Chi or Jian Wushuang. He wouldn’t be able to hide his tracks the moment they saw a new face like him.</p>
			<p>When he thought of a way to enter the Universe Vault, his eyes drifted over and caught sight of a massive ship flying towards the entrance. From the looks of it, it was a ship that belonged to the Universe First Race. </p>
			<p>He didn’t think anymore as he flew towards the ship. Breaking through the restrictions as though they weren’t there, to begin with, Huang Xiaolong hid on the ship.</p>
			<p>“This batch of slaves are pretty good… Lord Yin Xue will definitely be satisfied with them!” A voice came from inside the shop.</p>
			<p>“I wonder if the rumors of Lord Yin Xue’s special habits are true…”</p>
			<p>“We’re not allowed to talk about that!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong pretty much guessed what was going on after hearing their conversation. There was a batch of experts from the Thirteen Universes trapped in the ship as slaves.</p>
			<p>They should be for someone called Yin Xue of the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong entered the place where the prisoners were kept. He discovered that there were more than a hundred experts on the ship, and several of them were at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was shocked to see Pangu among them.</p>
			<p>“Master!” </p>
			<p>Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, shock filled Pangu’s heart as he muttered, “Xiao… Xiaolong?!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3708: Entering the Universe Space</p>
			</title>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong had changed his appearance before entering the ship, Pangu couldn’t recognize him immediately.</p>
			<p>Pangu wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect to meet Pangu there either.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong, were you captured too?” That was Pangu’s first reaction when he saw Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Despair filled his heart, and he sighed in resignation, “It’s over. If you were captured, no one would be able to save me from this place!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was shocked. He didn’t think that Pangu would worry about the person who would save him the moment they met.</p>
			<p>“Master, even if I was captured, I’ll think of a way to get you out!” Huang Xiaolong laughed.</p>
			<p>Pangu shook his head and sighed. “You have no idea. This group of people claims to be the first race born with the universes. They have several thousand half-step Universe Gods in their ranks!” </p>
			<p>“As long as one is captured by them, we will never be able to escape!” </p>
			<p>“They even have several experts who broke through the 20 billion units mark. Not even experts who have several hundred million units of grand cosmos energy can stand against them!”  </p>
			<p>A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Is that what they told you?” </p>
			<p>“Yeah. We were frequently beaten up on our way here. The person in charge of the ship told us everything. No one knows if it's true. However, we are pretty sure he’s not lying from how he said it.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued to ask, “Did they say how strong their Lord Yin Xue is?”</p>
			<p>Pangu shook his head and sighed, “They didn’t say anything about him.”</p>
			<p>“Lord Pangu, who is this?” a God of Creation at the grand completion stage asked.</p>
			<p>All of them might come from different places, but they were prisoners who were about to suffer the same fate. As such, they formed pretty good relationships with each other.</p>
			<p>“This is my disciple!” A proud expression could be seen on Pangu’s face when he introduced Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Your disciples?! Is he also a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage?!” someone else asked.</p>
			<p>Pangu finally realized the fact that Huang Xiaolong had already reached the peak of the grand completion stage. With shock in his eyes, he turned to Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Everyone there might not know that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds, but he knew!</p>
			<p>How in the world could they capture him with his strength?</p>
			<p>At the very best, the person in charge of the operation should possess 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy!</p>
			<p>Seeing how Huang Xiaolong was winking his eyes, Pangu realized what was going on.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand casually and laid down a brand on their souls. He controlled every single God of Creation instantly.</p>
			<p>He discovered that the Universe First Race also laid down a brand on their souls. It was too bad their restriction was no match for Huang Xiaolong. He was able to quickly take over.</p>
			<p>As for Pangu, Huang Xiaolong erased the soul brand completely. With his strength, the members of the Universe First Race would never be able to discover his methods.</p>
			<p>After he was done, he controlled the members of the Universe First Race driving the boat.</p>
			<p>The captain of the experts on the ship was an expert in his own right, but he only had 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy. No one could put up any resistance against Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Very quickly, the flying ship arrived at the entrance of the ship. After flashing Yin Xue’s plaque, they were allowed to enter. Along their way, they were checked multiple times. </p>
			<p>When they finally entered the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong stood on top of the ship as he took in the sights. Pangu was beside him and the master-and-disciple duo gasped in shock.𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝙗𝒏𝒐𝒗𝙚𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>“Is this actually real?!” Pangu muttered when he looked all around him.</p>
			<p>There were countless stars surrounding them as fluffy clouds drifted all about. Starlight fell onto the clouds and a picturesque scene was painted.</p>
			<p>Even though there wasn’t a sun, it was bright enough. The entire space gave off a refreshing vibe, unlike anything Huang Xiaolong had seen.</p>
			<p>“The spiritual energy here is too pure!” Pangu wiggled his nose like a husky as he cried out.</p>
			<p>Turning to Huang Xiaolong he asked, “Why don’t we stay here for some time before leaving?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Weren’t you praying for me to get you out when you were captured?”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t think this would be such a nice place…” </p>
			<p>“Alright. Just let me know when you wish to leave. I’ll pick you up then.” </p>
			<p>The flying ship continued on its way deeper into the Universe Vault.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and Pangu didn’t return to the interior of the ship as they discussed the dao on the deck. He asked Pangu about everything that happened in recent years.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong hadn’t been gone for long when Pangu decided to tour the universes. He had no idea how the members of the Huang Family were doing.</p>
			<p>In the past millions of years, Pangu managed to increase his strength a little. Of course, it was far from Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A month passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>Pangu sighed when he spoke to Huang Xiaolong. “Right now, I can’t even qualify to be your student…” </p>
			<p>After discussing the dao with Huang Xiaolong, he discovered that his disciple’s understanding of the grand dao had far surpassed his.</p>
			<p>“Nonsense. You will always be my teacher.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>When Pangu saw the serious look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he laughed, “Brat, of course, I’m your teacher! I won’t accept it if you try to take me in as your disciple!”</p>
			<p>Laughter filled the air. </p>
			<p>After several more months, they finally arrived in Yin Xue’s city.</p>
			<p>The moment the flying ship stopped, the members of the Universe First Race escorted Huang Xiaolong and the others out. They caught sight of a massive city sitting in a snowy plains. The entire city was refined from a special type of frosted metal essence and it spanned countless miles.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong summoned his dao souls instantly.</p>
			<p>From the memories of those from the Universe First Race, Yin Xue was an expert whose combat strength passed the 20 billion mark. He was the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King! </p>
			<p>Also, she was a lady!</p>
			<p>When they arrived, they went through another round of stringent checks before they were escorted to the dungeons.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked around only to discover that the entire structure was made from a special type of icy metal. There were complicated formations around the area and the moment they were activated, not even someone like the Limitless Master would be able to escape.</p>
			<p>Of course, Huang Xiaolong could leave anytime he wanted. Now, not even the Heaven Devouring King could stop him, much less his disciple.</p>
			<p>Other than those who just arrived, there were more than a hundred people there. From the looks of it, they were captured in the past.</p>
			<p>When they were still looking around, the prisoners started to gather around them with weird looks in their eyes.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3709: Controlling the Snow City</p>
			</title>
			<p>A frown formed on Pangu’s face as he looked at them. “What do you think you’re doing?” </p>
			<p>One of the half-step Universe Gods who was approaching said, “Let me tell you the rules governing this place.”</p>
			<p>“Rules?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow slowly.</p>
			<p>A sneer left the lips of the half-step Universe God. “Everyone who comes in here is a slave. All of you will have to listen to my order! I am your leader and those who refuse to listen to me will be tortured until they submit!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Pangu and a trace of amusement flashed through his eyes. Reaching out slightly, Huang Xiaolong dragged the man over. “Listen to your order? I refuse.” He looked at the hundred-odd God of Creation Realm experts behind the man and asked, “What can you do to me?” </p>
			<p>All of them stared at him in shock. The half-step Universe God who spoke earlier was the strongest among them! He could take on three to four other experts at the half-step Universe God Realm, but he was like a dead chicken in Huang Xiaolong’s hand!𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝓂</p>
			<p>The half-step Universe God was equally as shocked as he stared at Huang Xiaolong in terror. He could tell that Huang Xiaolong was at the peak of the grand completion stage. How can he be so damn strong?! </p>
			<p>“There’s no need to be afraid! No matter how strong he is, he’s alone! Attack! Kill him!” The half-step Universe God yelled, “I’ll explain to Lord Yin Xue if anything goes wrong! Kill him now!” </p>
			<p>Everyone charged at Huang Xiaolong when they heard what he said. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong remained completely indifferent when he looked at the number of people rushing towards him. With a wave of his arm, everyone was sent flying at the same time.</p>
			<p>Not a single person managed to resist his strength.</p>
			<p>When they finally slammed into the ground, miserable cries rang through the air.</p>
			<p>The half-step Universe God stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. There was a trace of fear in his eyes. How could anyone injure so many Gods of Creation at the same time?!</p>
			<p>Wouldn’t that mean that he was already…</p>
			<p>“Do you really think that you can kill me?” Huang Xiaolong growled.</p>
			<p>“Lord… I… I know my mistakes.” The half-step Universe God felt the expression on his face turning rigid. </p>
			<p>“You’ll have to face the consequences of your actions,” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he popped the half-step Universe God with a squeeze of his hand.</p>
			<p>The hearts of everyone present turned cold when they witnessed the scene.</p>
			<p>Throwing the dao soul of the half-step Universe God into the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong laid down restrictions in the souls of the others.</p>
			<p>When he was finally done, he looked at Pangu and chuckled, “Master, shall we take a stroll around the city?” </p>
			<p>“Alright!” </p>
			<p>With Huang Xiaolong around, there was nothing he would be afraid of.</p>
			<p>As such, the two of them passed through the restriction in the prison and arrived in the city above. </p>
			<p>Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong helped Pangu to alter his appearance and aura.</p>
			<p>The Snow City was extremely pretty.</p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong had been to countless cities, none of them could hold a candle to Snow City they were in.</p>
			<p>Every single structure in the Snow City was made from frosted metal essence. There wasn’t a single trace of impurity around.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong discovered that everyone in the city seemed to be pretty busy.</p>
			<p>As Snow City wasn’t the capital of the Snow Continent, Yin Xue’s manor wasn’t situated in the city.</p>
			<p>The Snow Continent spanned countless miles, and the highest ruler of the region was Yin Xue!</p>
			<p>She was an expert who broke through the 20 billion barrier, and she was also the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King. Her position in the Universe First Race wasn’t low, and she could easily rank in the top twenties.</p>
			<p>Of course, her strength closed in on the 22 billion mark. She wasn’t an expert who barely crossed the threshold.</p>
			<p>She was comparable to Zhu Chen of the Unknown Space!</p>
			<p>After Huang Xiaolong scanned through the memories of those who captured Pangu, he realized that Yin Xue wasn’t in the city. No one had any idea where she went.</p>
			<p>Naturally, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a rush. She would definitely return in the next few years. He would capture her and control her when the time came. Due to her position, he would be able to learn a lot of valuable information on the Universe First Race after he looked through her memories.</p>
			<p>Even if she had no idea who was setting up the Extermination Formation, there should definitely be some traces of information about what was going on.</p>
			<p>The only thing left to do was for Huang Xiaolong to gain control of the entire city before she returned. </p>
			<p>After casually strolling about with Pangu for a little bit, they arrived in the main manor in the city. Without a word, he controlled the city lord.</p>
			<p>As Snow City was one of the more important cities in the Snow Continent, the city lord wasn't too weak. He was an expert with 16 billion units of combat strength. It was too bad he was no weaker than an ant before Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong would explore the continent when he had nothing to do. He would bring Pangu around and Huang Xiaolong would control several experts who were in important positions in Yin Xue’s territory.</p>
			<p>One fine day, Huang Xiaolong was comprehending the mysteries behind the Nameless Devil Mirror when they sent him a report. They said that Yin Xue was about to return to the city. She would be back in a month at most, but she wasn’t the only one coming back. There were a bunch of experts of the Universe First Race coming along.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Do you know who they are?” </p>
			<p>The experts who made the report shook their heads.</p>
			<p>“Lord Yin Xue told us to prepare the banquet to welcome the guests,” one of them said.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong asked several of them the same question and after sending them away to reply Yin Xue, he went around to lay down the Star Dragon Grand Formation.</p>
			<p>Even though he had no idea who would be coming, he investigated the members of the Universe First Race since he entered the Universe Vault. He could guess who would be coming with her.</p>
			<p>The people who would travel with her would probably be experts who crossed the 20 billion mark. There were thirty of such experts in the Universe First Race, but there were only so many who had a good relationship with Yin Xue.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3710: My Men!</p>
			</title>
			<p>Several days later, Huang Xiaolong laid down the Star Dragon Grand Formation. Not content, he reinforced it several times. In total, he managed to strengthen it by three times.</p>
			<p>This time, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to allow any mishaps to occur. If he allowed the Heaven Devouring King to notice anything off, Huang Xiaolong could only run away from the Universe Vault with his tails tucked between his legs.𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>His grand cosmos energy might have broken through the 29 billion mark, but he wasn’t strong enough to fight the entire Universe First Race on his own! In fact, he wasn’t even an opponent for the White Feather King or the Black Nether King.</p>
			<p>Thinking about it for some time, Huang Xiaolong used the Golden Sun Circlet to reinforce the Star Dragon Grand Formation. Even though the universe treasure was used to defend himself, it possessed pretty strong restrictive powers.</p>
			<p>In the blink of an eye, a month passed.</p>
			<p>Several people appeared from the void and traveled towards the city.</p>
			<p>“Sister Yin Xue, your Snow City is the prettiest place in our Universe Vault! I never wish to leave after coming here…” A slender lady clad in crimson robes giggled at the side.</p>
			<p>“If Little Sister Feng likes it, you can stay here for as long as you like. I’ll finally get some company.” </p>
			<p>A young man clad in jade armor chuckled behind her, “Why don’t I stay with you?”  </p>
			<p>A soft laugh left Yin Xue’s lips. “Brother Bi Qing is too playful!” </p>
			<p>The youngster roared with laughter. </p>
			<p>“Actually, I miss the Enchanting Wine the most!” another man clad in gold joked.</p>
			<p>“Relax. I got my men to prepare the wine to welcome you. Little Brother Jin Long can drink to your heart’s content.” Yin Xue smiled.</p>
			<p>Amidst their laughter, they entered the city.</p>
			<p>Bi Qing sighed, “The structures here are really amazing..”</p>
			<p>“Big Brother Bi Qing, your Jade Sea Palace is the most exquisite building we’ve seen. You can’t compare it to my little Snow City…” Yin Xue giggled.</p>
			<p>With a grin on his face, Bi Qing didn’t say anything else.</p>
			<p>It was true. His Jade Sea Palace was much better than the Snow City!</p>
			<p>It was something he was extremely proud of!</p>
			<p>Naturally, his teacher had a part to play in it.</p>
			<p>Countless experts emerged from the city in order to welcome Yin Xue and those around her. </p>
			<p>When they arrived before Yin Xue, all of them bowed respectfully.</p>
			<p>Allowing them to get up, she followed them into the city.</p>
			<p>“Did anything happen when I was away?” she asked.</p>
			<p>“Nope. Everything remained the same,” someone in the group replied.</p>
			<p>After asking several other questions, her trusted attendants replied without allowing her to notice anything wrong with the state of the city.</p>
			<p>Yin Xue invited Bi Qing, Chi Feng, and Jin Long into her palace where the banquet had already been prepared.</p>
			<p>Jin Long’s eyes lit up when he saw the jars of wine placed along the table. “I’ve been thinking about the Enchanting Wine for such a long time!”</p>
			<p>Yin Xue chuckled, “You can’t enjoy good wine without beauties by your side…” Clapping her hands, a group of pretty ladies whose bodies were barely covered in a layer of cloth entered the hall. Every one of them was an absolute beauty and their movements were bewitching. </p>
			<p>Bi Qing looked at them and joked, “The Dazzling Flowers in younger sister Yin Xue’s palace are really famous. I finally get to meet them!”</p>
			<p>As they took their seats, the banquet quickly reached its peak.</p>
			<p>“Sister Yin Xue, you should know that I was sent by my master…” Bi Qing placed his cup down and muttered.</p>
			<p>“Of course. How can I forget?” Turning to one of her attendants, Yin Xue ordered, “Bring the slaves over. Let Lord Bi Qing pick some of them out.”</p>
			<p>Bowing slightly, the attendant left.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong and the others stood before Yin Xue, Bi Qing, Chi Feng, and Jin Long.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong and Pangu took off their disguises, Huang Xiaolong was like a sore thumb that stood out from the crowd. All of them turned to look at him instantly. </p>
			<p>“Huang Long Bloodline?! Big Sister, can I have this slave?” Chi Feng pointed at Huang Xiaolong as she exclaimed. “I require the bloodlines of a bunch of experts from the Dragon Race in order to refine a batch of pills!”</p>
			<p>Jin Long chuckled, “You need his bloodline and I need his dao soul. Give me his dao soul when you’re done. I need to refine my Dragon Spear with the dao souls of those from the Dragon Race.”</p>
			<p>“Since the two of you like him, you can have him.” Yin Xue smiled. Turning to one of her generals, she exclaimed, “Take him down. Chi Feng and Jin Long will bring him away when they leave.”</p>
			<p>Despite giving the order, the general didn’t move.</p>
			<p>Narrowing her eyes, Yin Xue snapped at him, “Didn’t you hear what I said?” </p>
			<p>Even so, he didn’t respond.</p>
			<p>Bi Qing sneered when he saw what was going on. “Looks like someone dares to ignore your order…”</p>
			<p>As her arm shot out, she wanted to slap the general across the face. It was too bad a ray of sword light stopped her dead in her tracks.</p>
			<p>All four of them stared at the sword light in shock.</p>
			<p>Turning to look at the source, they saw Huang Xiaolong walking towards them.</p>
			<p>“Did you do that?!” Yin Xue couldn’t believe what was going on.</p>
			<p>She knew that there was no way a random slave would be able to stop her attack. Moreover, the person standing before her was an expert at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.</p>
			<p>Ignoring her, Huang Xiaolong arrived before them. He muttered, “Yin Xue, Bi Qing, Chi Feng, Jin Long… Four of the six geniuses of the Universe First Race are here… What a pity. Heaven Tyrant and the Ninth Void aren’t here. Otherwise, I would have saved my time.” </p>
			<p>The six geniuses of the Universe First Race were the most talented disciples of the second generation of those from the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>All six of them were disciples of the thirteen kings!</p>
			<p>Yin Xue was the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King, Bi Qing was the only disciple of the Star Refining King. Chi Feng was the second disciple of the Golden Cymbals King, and Jin Long was a hidden disciple of the Golden Qilin King!</p>
			<p>Ninth Void was a disciple of the White Feathers King, and Heaven Tyrant was the disciple of the Black Nether King!</p>
			<p>Heaven Tyrant ranked first among the six, followed by Ninth Void, Bi Qing, and Yin Xue.</p>
			<p>“This guy is pretty interesting… Brat, looks like you managed to sneak your way in here!” Jin Long chuckled. “That’s weird. You’re just a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. Who gave you the confidence to speak to us like that? Do you really think that you’re someone special? Humph. Your sword qi is pretty impressive, I’ll give you that.”</p>
			<p>Yin Xue waved her hand and roared at the generals behind her, “Take him down right now!”</p>
			<p>It was too bad no one moved.</p>
			<p>“There’s no need for you to give them any more orders. They are now my men,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>After he spoke, he looked at the generals beside her and those of the Universe First Race. All of them took a step back at once, and they kneeled to face Huang Xiaolong.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3711: Suppressing Yin Xue</p>
			</title>
			<p>Yin Xue and the others looked at the experts who were kneeling along the street. They couldn’t help but widen their eyes in shock. </p>
			<p>Almost every single person who kneeled on the ground was a city lord on the Snow Continent. Yin Xue’s generals and trusted aides were also among them.</p>
			<p>All of them surrendered to a mere slave!</p>
			<p>“Who the hell are you?!” Yin Xue leaped to her feet as a fire burned in her eyes. The gaze when she looked at Huang Xiaolong was no longer as indifferent as it once was. He had to be a true expert if he could control all of these people.</p>
			<p>One had to know that there were two generals under Yin Xue whose combat prowess had crossed the 19 billion units mark! Even they weren’t spared!</p>
			<p>How could Huang Xiaolong be an ordinary slave?</p>
			<p>The three other experts beside her also got to their feet.</p>
			<p>They stared at Huang Xiaolong cautiously.𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p>Even so, they couldn’t understand how a mere God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage could control so many powerhouses from the Universe First Race! </p>
			<p>“You’ll find out about my identity soon,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “After all, you’re going to become my slave too!” </p>
			<p>He might have called all those who submitted to him his subordinates, but he had no mercy towards people like Yin Xue and the like.</p>
			<p>Rage filled their hearts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>Jin Long was the first to respond as he snorted with contempt, “Our Universe First Race has always been the rulers of the universe! Every single member of the Thirteen Universes is our slave! Brat, you’ll die a horrible death for what you just said!” A golden spear appeared in his hand as he slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“I’ll teach you the rule that existed since ancient times. Your race was destined to be slaves of our Universe First Race! You’re no exception!” </p>
			<p>After he spoke, his spear stabbed at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A blinding light filled the space before him.</p>
			<p>As though it stabbed into the dao hearts of everyone present, those standing around felt a sharp pain shooting through their chest.</p>
			<p>It was too bad he was a weakling compared to Huang Xiaolong. With his bare hands, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the spear. The spear was nothing more than a toy in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.</p>
			<p>With his expression changing drastically, Jin Long felt as though he had driven his spear through a world barrier! </p>
			<p>When he was still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong’s palm arrived above his head.</p>
			<p>Even though it looked like an extremely ordinary attack, Jin Long felt as though the entire universe was crashing down on him! The boundless universe contained the strength of every single being in existence and he felt like an ant before it. No matter how hard he tried, he knew that there was no escaping the frightening blow!</p>
			<p>Not even his special techniques of traveling through space would allow him to escape!</p>
			<p>“Save me!” Jin Long yelled at Bi Qing and the others.</p>
			<p>Leaping at Huang Xiaolong in unison, the three of them defended Jin Long from the terrifying blow. A divine halberd appeared in Bi Qing’s hand and a snow-white sword appeared in Yin Xue’s palm. A giant flaming fan appeared before Chi Feng.</p>
			<p>Without batting an eyelid, Huang Xiaolong casually swept the three of them away as though they were merely annoying flies blocking his way.</p>
			<p>As he swung his arms out to shoo them away, the three of them felt their brains tingling. They couldn’t help but dodge. </p>
			<p>It was too bad that the three of them were still struck by the powerful blow as they were sent flying. They smashed into the ground quite a distance away.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t loosen his grip on Jin Long.</p>
			<p>When he saw the look of terror on Jin Long’s face, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Nothing is eternal in the universe. You might be the representation of absolute power in the past, but that might change in the future. Humans might be the slaves of the Universe First Race in the past, but in the future, your race will become my slaves! You’ll be slaves of Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong?! You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Yin Xue yelled in the distance.</p>
			<p>The faces of Bi Qing and the others changed.</p>
			<p>When the Golden Cymbals King was defeated by Huang Xiaolong back in the Netherworld, the Universe First Race learned about it. That was the reason the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Qilin King were dispatched to the Unknown Space in order to deal with the man! Eventually, their plan was thwarted by the appearance of the Ferocious Devil! When that happened, the higher-ups of the Universe First Race raised their caution to the maximum.</p>
			<p>Their evaluation of Huang Xiaolong placed him as the second strongest expert in the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>People like Yin Xue and the others learned about it and they were extremely shocked to hear his name.</p>
			<p>“That’s right, I’m Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong looked at them and continued, “Today, none of you will escape.”</p>
			<p>Shattering their transmission symbols, Yin Xue, Bi Qing, and Chi Feng wanted to send a message to their masters to rescue them. However, endless starlight fell from the void. It covered the lands as countless roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree extended to cover the skies. The Golden Sun Circlet turned into a massive golden dragon that sealed off the continent.</p>
			<p>They realized that their cries for help were blocked off completely.</p>
			<p>“That’s the Star Dragon Divine Tree!” When the Golden Cymbals King returned, he said that Huang Xiaolong possessed several universe treasures when they fought. As such, they knew that Huang Xiaolong had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Golden Sun Circlets, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, and Three Gods Halberd.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, if anything happens to us, our masters will learn of it immediately! Do you really think you can escape then?” Yin Xue roared.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong spoke indifferently, “There’s no need for you to worry about that. Do you really think that I’ll allow your masters to learn about this?” </p>
			<p>Yin Xue and the others felt their hearts thumping in their chests.</p>
			<p>When they were about to go crazy and unleash everything they had on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong moved. He activated all three great worlds within him as 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body. As soon as it appeared, Yin Xue and the others felt the weight of the universe pressing down against them and they were forced to the ground.</p>
			<p>They couldn’t help but gasp in shock.</p>
			<p>“How… How is this possible?!” Yin Xue cried. “Don’t you only have 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy?!”</p>
			<p>Bullsh*t! Huang Xiaolong was far stronger than they described! Not even the Heaven Devouring King was as strong as Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p>“Well, that’s because your information is outdated.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.</p>
			<p>?!</p>
			<p>The four of them didn’t know what was going on. Just three million years ago, Huang Xiaolong was a God of Creation with less than 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, he reached the 29 billion mark!</p>
			<p>He effortlessly suppressed all four of them and he branded their souls to control them.</p>
			<p>When he was done, Huang Xiaolong got Yin Xue to gather all the experts of the Snow Continent. He gained complete control over the Snow Continent easily.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3712: Meeting the Star Refining King</p>
			</title>
			<p>It was a pretty sight as night fell on the Snow Continent.</p>
			<p>Standing in the air above the lands, Huang Xiaolong watched streaks of light flashing on the horizon.</p>
			<p>From Bi Qing, he learned that the Star Refining King sent him over to look for a bunch of experts who were adept in the art of formations. He was to bring them back to the Jade Sea Palace to await his instructions.</p>
			<p>Bi Qing had no idea what his master needed them for, but Huang Xiaolong was able to make the connection.</p>
			<p>If he wasn’t mistaken, the Star Refinement King wanted to use the batch of slaves to lay down the Extermination Formation! </p>
			<p>Did the Black Nether King teach the Star Refinement King the way to lay down the grand formation?!</p>
			<p>In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the Nameless Devil Mirror. At the same time, he wanted to collect all the universe-level spiritual veins he could.</p>
			<p>According to the Ferocious Devil’s guesses, the Black Nether King would be able to activate the Extermination Formation within a million years. He needed to break through the barrier to enter the half-step Universe God before that in order to challenge the Black Nether King!</p>
			<p>It was too difficult for him to do anything like it! Even with the Universe Boat, he didn’t even dare to dream of it! He might have the Universe Transformation Art and the universe source qi to assist him, but it was just too difficult! The only way was to obtain an endless amount of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins! </p>
			<p>That was the only way he could break through smoothly to the half-step Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>Yin Xue was someone who ranked in the top twenty of the Universe First Race. The resources she owned were shocking! She had nearly everything under the sun, but Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that there wasn’t a single universe-level spiritual vein in the treasury! </p>
			<p>When he asked her, he discovered that several hundred thousand years ago, the Black Nether King gave the order to hand over all the universe-level spiritual veins they had!</p>
			<p>“Other than the Snow Continent, there isn’t a single spiritual vein to be found anywhere else?!” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>Bi Qing and the others nodded in response.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He didn’t think that that would happen. That would mean that he wouldn’t be able to cultivate effectively and break through within a million years!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could guess what the Black Nether King needed so many spiritual veins for. In order to activate the Extermination Formation, he would need a frightening amount of energy. As such, he planned to use the spiritual veins as an energy source for the formation.</p>
			<p>“Did all the spiritual veins go to the Black Nether King?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.</p>
			<p>Yin Xue shook her head and sighed, “No. Lord Black Nether King got us to hand the spiritual veins over to the Jade Sea Palace.”</p>
			<p>“Jade Sea Palace?” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Bi Qing.</p>
			<p>“My master retrieved all of them after they arrived.” </p>
			<p>A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</p>
			<p>That would basically confirm his guess. The Star Refinement King was in charge of laying down the Extermination Formation!</p>
			<p>“Star Refinement King…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. </p>
			<p>The Star Refinement King’s combat strength has already crossed the 29 billion mark. If Huang Xiaolong didn’t use his universe treasures, he might be slightly weaker than the man. If he used everything he had, he would be able to suppress the Star Refinement King with no problems.</p>
			<p>Suppressing was one matter, forcing the opponent to submit was another. Even if he managed to suppress the Star Refinement King, he might allow the party to escape.</p>
			<p>If that happened, the consequences would be too serious to bear!𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows were locked tightly together.</p>
			<p>Several days later…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong left the city and headed straight for the Jade Sea Palace.</p>
			<p>When Bi Qing and Yin Xue brought the group of slaves back to the Jade Sea Palace, the Star Refinement King would have to appear to bring them away. That would be his best shot at interacting with the Star Refinement King and Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to waste the chance.</p>
			<p>No matter how he looked at it, the most important thing he had to do was to learn the secrets of the Extermination Formation. He would interrupt their plans by destroying the eye of the formation!</p>
			<p>Bi Qing’s flying ship was nowhere near the speed of the Universe Boat, and they would need several years in order to arrive at the Jade Sea Palace.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t slacken off, and he continued to comprehend the mysteries of the Nameless Devil Mirror.</p>
			<p>Several years later…</p>
			<p>“Lord, we have arrived!” Bi Qing made a report when Huang Xiaolong was still deep in meditation.</p>
			<p>Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the flying ship. He walked over to the bow of the ship and saw an endless sea that was jade green in color under them. There were countless palaces on the surface of the sea, and there were bubbles that shone with a multitude of lights hovering in the air.</p>
			<p>One would discover countless images if one looked closely at the bubbles.</p>
			<p>The Jade Sea had a different charm than the Snow Continent. It gave off an air of freedom that soothed the soul. It was especially so for the bubbles that existed above the sea. It was no wonder Yin Xue said that her Snow Continent was incomparable to that of the Jade Sea. </p>
			<p>A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the palace. Bi Qing contacted his master, the Star Refinement King, and quickly got a reply.</p>
			<p>“My master said that he is caught up with something right now, and he will only be able to return after a year,” Bi Hai said.</p>
			<p>“One year…” Huang Xiaolong muttered. He wasn’t in a rush. He could take the time to control the experts in the region.</p>
			<p>Soon after, he got Bi Qing to gather the experts of the Jade Sea, and he controlled them quickly.</p>
			<p>A year later, the Star Refinement King returned.</p>
			<p>He was a shorty, and his height didn’t even reach the 1.5 meters mark! His facial features were ordinary, and there was nothing special about him. No one would think that he was the Star Refinement King if he walked along the streets.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong followed a batch of humans, and they made their way over to the Star Refinement King.</p>
			<p>Looking at the batch of slaves that was brought to him, the Star Refinement King looked at Bi Qing and praised, “This batch isn’t too bad.”</p>
			<p>“Many thanks to master!” </p>
			<p>Soon after, the Star Refinement King tested them in the art of arrays. When they finally reached his required standard, he brought them away from the palace.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3713: Concealment</p>
			</title>
			<p>After they left, they headed north.</p>
			<p>The Star Refinement King’s flying ship was fast, but it wasn’t as quick as the Universe Boat. Of course, it was fast compared to Bi Qing’s ship.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and the others were kept in one of the spaces on the ship and they weren’t given a giant area either. They had a little more than a thousand square feet, and it felt a little cramped with more than four hundred people.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt as though they were pigs locked up in a sty.</p>
			<p>Releasing his dao souls, he looks at the situation outside the space.</p>
			<p>Even though the Star Refinement King personally laid down the formations around the room, they were unable to stop Huang Xiaolong in the slightest.</p>
			<p>He didn’t spy on the Star Refinement King in case he was detected.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that they wouldn’t arrive even after two years of flying!</p>
			<p>Initially, he could see several continents that existed in the Universe Vault. The more they flew, the more barren it became. </p>
			<p>The flying ship only stopped after three more years.</p>
			<p>When the Star Refinement King got his men to bring Huang Xiaolong and the others out, they were brought to a barren field. Huang Xiaoong could see that there wasn’t anything else other than several mountains.</p>
			<p>As the Star Refinement King stood on a massive platform in the skies, he stared at the group of ‘slaves’ below him and snorted, “All of you will have to complete your task every day! Anyone who fails to do so will be skinned and your dao soul will be punished! Do you understand?!” </p>
			<p>He released his aura to scare the group of slaves when he was done speaking.</p>
			<p>Nodding profusely, the group acknowledged what he said.</p>
			<p>“I laid down countless formations in a hundred million-mile radius. Not even experts who have crossed the 20 billion units mark will be able to escape. I hope you don’t think of anything stupid,” The Star Refinement King growled. “Anyone who tries will suffer a fate worse than death!” </p>
			<p>Soon after, he laid down several other rules.</p>
			<p>When he was done, he turned to an expert from the Universe First Race and announced, “Give them their instructions for today.” </p>
			<p>After speaking, he disappeared from his spot.</p>
			<p>The expert handed all of them a slab that contained their task for the day. There was an extremely detailed instruction manual on what they had to do.</p>
			<p>“Remember, you are not allowed to exchange your plaques. Do not let anyone else see your task.” One of the experts harrumphed, “Anyone who breaks the rule will suffer the consequences!” </p>
			<p>“These are the resources you will need. Do not waste them. Return everything when you are done with your task.” Someone else handed them a spatial tool each.</p>
			<p>All of them were required to inscribe some runes related to the Extermination Formation, but they were all in charge of different aspects. As such, the resources they were given were different.</p>
			<p>It seemed as though they would be working on different parts every day.</p>
			<p>A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He could tell that the runes they were inscribing would be used to destroy the Thirteen Universes in the future!</p>
			<p>A snort left his lips. Since that was the case, he would have to do a little something to the runes he was about to inscribe.</p>
			<p>Even though the Star Refinement King would definitely look through the runes, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could hide his tricks from the man!</p>
			<p>After all, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding in the art of arrays had reached a terrifying level. It was especially so after he comprehended the mysteries of the universe from the images in the Nameless Devil Mirror.</p>
			<p>In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong inscribed the runes while laying down his soul brand on them.</p>
			<p>Even though he was only in charge of a tiny portion of the formation, it was more than enough! When the time came, Huang Xiaolong could shatter the formation slowly with the things he did to the runes!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had always been observing his surroundings when he inscribed the runes.</p>
			<p>Indeed. There was a formation around the entire area laid down by the Star Refinement King. Not even experts who had broken through the 20 billion units mark could escape, but it was nothing to Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>As such, he would leave the area every day to look at the surroundings.</p>
			<p>There were countless palaces surrounding the area, and all of them shone with a dark golden light. Huang Xiaolong discovered that every single palace housed an expert from the Universe First Race and they were also there to inscribe the runes. He could tell that they were doing the same job, just that the treatment they received was different.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and the others weren’t even given a place to rest while the members of the Universe First Race were given a palace each!</p>
			<p>Even though the palaces were surrounded by powerful formations, they were nothing to Huang Xiaolong. He could enter wherever he wished.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Huang Xiaolong arrived outside the largest palace. </p>
			<p>“My master said that we have to ensure a smooth activation of the Extermination Formation! We should be able to complete it in the next eight hundred thousand years!” A voice came from inside the palace.</p>
			<p>“Go and make a report to Lord Black Nether. Tell him that he can rest assured that I will complete the task.” The Star Refinement King sighed. “Get the rest to look for another batch of slaves from the Thirteen Universes.”</p>
			<p>“We also need to inspect the runes inscribed by the slaves. We cannot allow for any mistakes!”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I will personally ensure that everything is in place. I will also inspect the runes inscribed by our disciples,” The Star Refinement King muttered.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes slightly. From the looks of it, the Star Refinement King should be speaking to the Black Nether King’s disciple, Heaven Tyrant!</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to see a black figure disappearing into the void.𝗳𝗿𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝐥.𝐜𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Looking at his leaving figure, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment. He wanted to capture Heaven Tyrant, but he decided against it. After all, the Black Nether King wasn’t someone he could mess around with! If he controlled the Black Nether King’s disciple, he would be discovered in a heartbeat!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sneakily returned to his task.</p>
			<p>From the looks of it, there were countless people working on the formation elsewhere!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued whatever he was doing in the following days. He had already discovered that the universe-level spiritual veins were hidden in the treasury of the Star Refinement King’s palace!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3714: 29.9 Billion</p>
			</title>
			<p>A year passed uneventfully.</p>
			<p>Throughout the year, Huang Xiaolong had been completing his task given by the members of the Universe First Race. However, the Star Refinement King failed to leave his palace even after such a long time!</p>
			<p>Even if he did, it was to inspect their work.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was in no rush. The Star Refinement King got them to capture another batch of slaves, and he would have to return to the Jade Sea Palace in order to bring them over. When that happened, Huang Xiaolong would take action!</p>
			<p>Indeed. </p>
			<p>Several years later, Bi Qing and the others brought another batch of slaves over to the Jade Sea Palace and the Star Refinement King left. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong only made his move a few days after the Star Refinement King was gone. </p>
			<p>Without the Star Refinement King to hold down the fort, Huang Xiaolong quickly arrived before his palace.𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝒏𝙤𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝙤𝒎 </p>
			<p>Those who were in charge of the slaves had long since been controlled by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Before the guards in the palace could react, Huang Xiaolong suppressed all of them. He used a little bit of time to tear through the formation guarding the treasury before making his way into it.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had seen countless treasuries in the past, but even if he added everything of worth from all of them, it wouldn’t compare to the Star Refinement King’s treasury!</p>
			<p>The number of treasures kept within was something that shocked even Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>Treasures that could make the world outside go crazy were stacked high like massive mountains in the space within.</p>
			<p>The treasury was like a great world that contained many smaller worlds. Every single inch of the space was filled with precious treasures, and there were even some that Huang Xiaolong didn’t recognize!</p>
			<p>It seemed as though the treasury contained every single ingredient the Universe First Race needed to lay down the Extermination Formation. </p>
			<p>Casually walking deeper into the treasury, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the core of the treasury. That was where the universe-level spiritual veins were held!</p>
			<p>He was blasted by waves of universe spiritual qi when he arrived, and Huang Xiaolong felt his heart palpitating with excitement.</p>
			<p>He could see that the area before him was larger than any holy world he had been to. The whole space was filled with the universe spiritual qi that was purer than anything Huang Xiaolong had felt before!</p>
			<p>There were countless spiritual veins floating in the air and there were hundreds of top-grade spiritual veins drifting about!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong might have seen a lot of universe-level spiritual veins in the past, but that was the first time he was seeing hundreds of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins floating before him!</p>
			<p>In the outside world, it would be difficult to locate even a single one!</p>
			<p>Suppressing his excitement, Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath.</p>
			<p>The spiritual veins there were more than enough to allow him to break through to the next level!</p>
			<p>The only thing left for him to do was to collect them all.</p>
			<p>Even though the spiritual veins were branded by the Star Refinement King, it was only a matter of time before Huang Xiaolong wiped his soul brand away. Since it took them three years to arrive, the Star Refinement King would take six years to make a return trip! It was more than enough time for Huang Xiaolong to retrieve all the spiritual veins!</p>
			<p>Without delay, Huang Xiaolong started on his new task.</p>
			<p>It took him several days in order to cleanse the first one!</p>
			<p>He was in no hurry to start on the next one. Instead, he retrieved a high-level universe-level spiritual vein from the Universe Boat and replaced it.</p>
			<p>Even if the Star Refinement King returned, he wouldn’t be able to discover the difference.</p>
			<p>When he was done, Huang Xiaolong started on the next vein. He repeated the process and disguised the second vein before putting it back. </p>
			<p>The spiritual veins he used were lower-leveled ones he collected. They might not have any top-grade universe-level spiritual veins on them, but they had those of lower level!</p>
			<p>Four years later, Huang Xiaolong kept all the top-grade universe-level spiritual veins in the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>He nearly danced with joy when he saw his new stash. Leaving the treasury, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Snow Continent.</p>
			<p>He planned to enter seclusion there to break through to the 29.9 billion mark! The only reason he chose to return to the Snow Continent was because of Pangu’s presence. If the Star Refinement King really discovered anything off, he would be able to grab Pangu before leaving the Universe Vault.</p>
			<p>When he arrived, he entered seclusion immediately. He ordered Bi Qing, Yin Xue, Chi Feng, and Jin Long to take note of anything unusual.</p>
			<p>Several hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>It seemed as though the Star Refinement King was unaware of what happened as no one made a report to him.</p>
			<p>Finally starting on his cultivation, more than six hundred thousand years passed.</p>
			<p>Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong eventually left the Universe Boat. Stretching slightly, he took a deep breath.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3715: Universe Source Stone</p>
			</title>
			<p>After his seclusion, Huang Xiaolong reached the 29.9 billion mark. In fact, he was one strand of grand cosmos energy away from reaching the 30 billion mark!</p>
			<p>He reached his current level more than a hundred thousand years ago. However, he had been trying to break through with all his might but to no avail. It was like when he tried to break through to the peak of the grand competition stage in the past!</p>
			<p>All these years, Huang Xiaolong might have tried to understand the mysteries of the Nameless Devil Mirror, but he only managed to comprehend thirty to forty percent of it. He was slightly lacking when it came to entering the half-step Universe God Realm.</p>
			<p>He wanted to continue his seclusion in order to understand the mysteries behind the Thirteen Universes, but Bi Qing returned with news that the White Feather King’s search for a Universe Source Stone found some headway in the past few years.</p>
			<p>How could Huang Xiaolong not know what the Universe Source Stone was?</p>
			<p>He heard from the Ferocious Devil that the Universe Source Stone was the core of the Extermination Formation. The first Extermination Tribulation suffered by the Thirteen Universes was extremely powerful due to the presence of the Universe Source Stone!</p>
			<p>The Universe Source Stone was created by the Thirteen Universes during their birth. Legends had it that it was the source of the Thirteen Universes. It was the reason behind the birth of spiritual energy in all the lands.</p>
			<p>It was extremely hard to locate even a single piece, and the Universe First Race only managed to find one after god knows how many years. Who would have thought that they would be able to locate another one?</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was unable to stop the Extermination Formation in the past, but now that he had reached his current level, he would stop them with everything he had! He couldn’t allow them to obtain the piece of Universe Source Stone! </p>
			<p>Even though he made some alterations to the runes he inscribed, the Black Nether King would be able to discover his petty tricks the moment they activated the formation. He might be able to destroy the formation once, but once they fixed it, he wouldn’t be able to do it again!</p>
			<p>As for the universe-level spiritual veins he stole, he was sure that the Universe First Race would simply use a vast quantity of lower leveled spiritual veins to activate the formation.</p>
			<p>As such, all his tricks up to this point were pretty much useful in delaying them slightly. If he obtained the Universe Source Stone, he would really be able to impact their activation of the formation.</p>
			<p>Without the source stone, they could only use something else for the core of their formation. That would greatly affect the power behind the formation and the tribulation would decrease in strength. If the Black Nether King wanted to use the tribulation to harvest all the lives in the Thirteen Universes, it would be much more difficult with Huang Xiaolong’s presence.𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝙗𝒏𝒐𝒗𝙚𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>If he failed this time, no one knew when the Black Nether King could try again. When that happened, Huang Xiaolong’s chances of entering the Universe God Realm before him would be so much higher!</p>
			<p>Leaving the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong saw Bi Qing and Yin Xue.</p>
			<p>“Lord!” They bowed respectfully.</p>
			<p>He asked about matters regarding the Universe Source Stone when they got up.</p>
			<p>“The White Feather King has already left to obtain the stone,” Bi Qing mentioned.</p>
			<p>“Do you know where he went?” </p>
			<p>Bi Qing shook his head slowly and replied, “No one knows where he went. The last we heard, he left the Universe Vault in search of the Universe Source Stone.”</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. It was useless if he didn’t know where the White Feather King went. There was no way he could search aimlessly. The Thirteen Universes were boundless, and even if he used several hundred million years, he might not be able to discover anything! By that time, the Universe Source Stone would have already landed in the White Feather King’s hands!</p>
			<p>“His disciple, Ninth Void, might know where he went,” Yin Xue muttered. “The White Feather King has always doted on his disciple.”</p>
			<p>“NInth Void!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</p>
			<p>As the White Feather King’s inheritance disciple, he might really know where his master went!</p>
			<p>“Where is Ninth Void now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>“He left the Ninth Void Valley several months ago for the Blue Phoenix Palace.”</p>
			<p>“Blue Phoenix Palace?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. Ninth Void has always been interested in Qing Luan,” Bi Qing muttered.</p>
			<p>Qing Luan, the owner of the Blue Phoenix Palace, was the daughter of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King.</p>
			<p>The Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King ranked below the Golden Cymbals King. The Golden Cymbals King was ranked sixth among the kings, and the Blood Phoenix Queen ranked seventh. The Titan King was ranked eighth, but they were the only couple among the thirteen kings.</p>
			<p>Qing Luan, Yin Xue, and Chi Feng were the greatest beauties in the Universe First Race. However, Qing Luan was weaker than the other two in terms of talent. Her combat abilities were stuck at the 19 billion mark and she wasn’t able to compete for the position of the six geniuses.</p>
			<p>Even so, she was a goddess in the eyes of the men in the Universe First Race. Ninth Void was one of her many suitors.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong heard that Ninth Void had left his palace, he grabbed Pangu and left.</p>
			<p>When he fought for the Universe Source Stone, everyone in the Universe First Race would know that Pangu was his master. Since they couldn’t kill Huang Xiaolong, their target would shift over to Pangu! In order to keep his master safe, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring him away from the Universe Vault. </p>
			<p>As the Blue Phoenix Palace wasn’t located too far away from the Snow Continent, Huang Xiaolong arrived in less than a month.</p>
			<p>Releasing his dao souls, he discovered Ninth Void’s presence almost immediately. Qing Luan was hosting him with a massive banquet, and there were countless experts present. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong discovered the presence of two supreme experts with close to 27 billion units of combat abilities.</p>
			<p>There was no room for doubt. It was the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King! </p>
			<p>Even though they were both present, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried in the slightest. He might have been afraid of them in the past, but right now, he could suppress them with a single arm!</p>
			<p>Summoning the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong sent countless branches into the void to seal off the space around the city.</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>Qing Luan giggled slightly when she looked at Ninth Void. “I heard that Big Brother Ninth Void managed to obtain the Golden Crow Divine Tree from the Golden Crow Divine Race…”</p>
			<p>The Golden Crow Divine Tree might not be comparable to the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but it was an absolute treasure in the Thirteen Universes!</p>
			<p>“Little Sister Qing Luan is really well-informed!” Reaching out slightly, a tiny tree appeared in his palm. Golden flames filled the space around him and one could make out tiny golden crows if they looked closely.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3716: Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King</p>
			</title>
			<p>Qing Luan’s eyes lit up when she saw the divine tree in his hands.</p>
			<p>“If Little Sister Qing Luan likes this divine tree, I’ll give it to you!” Ninth Void chuckled.</p>
			<p>A pretty smile appeared on Qing Luan’s face. “Didn’t Big Brother Ninth Void obtain the Golden Crow Tree after sacrificing a lot?”</p>
			<p>One of the young men clad in golden armor sitting in the hall mocked, “Ninth Void, in order to obtain the Golden Crow Divine Tree, you massacred the entire Golden Crow Divine Race. You didn’t even allow the babies to escape! The blood of billions stains the Golden Crow Divine Tree and you’re planning to dirty Little Sister Qing Luan’s hand with them?”</p>
			<p>The youngster was the Star Refinement King’s son, Cong Dan. He was also interested in Qing Luan, and he had always been going against Ninth Void.</p>
			<p>A snort left Ninth Void’s lips. “Aren’t your hands also stained with the blood of our slaves? Practically every other year, you’ll kill a batch of slaves. Most of them are females… From what I’ve heard, none of them died with a complete corpse. Moreover, most of them were brought out from your room!” </p>
			<p>“You!” Cong Dan raged as Ninth Void remained completely impassive.𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝒷𝓃𝑜𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p>Before Qing Luan could speak, a figure appeared in the middle of the hall, shocking everyone present.</p>
			<p>When they saw that the newcomer was a ‘slave’ from the Human Race, their eyes widened in shock. </p>
			<p>All of them turned to look at Qing Luan as they thought that the slave belonged to her.</p>
			<p>However, Qing Luan’s expression sank as she addressed Huang Xiaolong. “Who the h*ll are you?! Are you tired of living?! You’re a mere slave and you dare to intrude into my palace…”</p>
			<p>“Slave?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow. “Relax. Very soon, your Universe First Race will turn into the slaves of my Human Race!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had long since made up his mind. After entering the Universe God Realm, the first thing he would do was to enslave the members of the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>With nearly 30 billion units of grand cosmos energy, he was no longer far from the Universe God Realm.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong believed that as long as he concentrated on the Nameless Devil Mirror, he would be able to break through in the next ten million years!</p>
			<p>When they heard what Huang Xiaolong said, the members of the Universe First Race flew into a rage.</p>
			<p>“Preposterous!” </p>
			<p>“How dare you?!” </p>
			<p>“On your knees, you slave!”</p>
			<p>Someone leaped at Huang Xiaolong from within the crowd in an attempt to take him down.</p>
			<p>He might not be an expert who crossed the 20 billion mark, but he was close! He was a pretty famous figure in the Universe First Race, and his attack contained the power to shatter worlds!</p>
			<p>One could say that he was stronger than Gui Chi from the Unknown Space! The Universe First Race was said to be born with the strongest constitution in the universes, and his talent was even stronger than the likes of Gui Chi and the rest!</p>
			<p>Despite that, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at him. When the expert’s palm landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, a terrifying backlash sent him flying.</p>
			<p>When they saw the expert flying into the distance with blood spewing from his lips, Ninth Void, and the others were dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>“What?!”</p>
			<p>Their expressions changed.</p>
			<p>Everyone sat up in unison as they looked at Huang Xiaolong with fear in their eyes.</p>
			<p>“Who… Who might you be?!” Cong Dan looked at Huang Xiaolong and asked.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong.”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p>The only person who could sneer was Ninth Void. “Humph. Huang Xiaolong, you’re pretty daring to barge into my Universe Vault. Since you came, there’s no need for you to return.”</p>
			<p>Qing Luan secretly contacted her parents when the exchange was going on.</p>
			<p>There was no doubt her little actions were caught by Huang Xiaolong, but he chose to let it go. After all, he wanted to deal with the two kings too.</p>
			<p>“Do you really think so?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Do you really think that the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King are enough to take me down?”</p>
			<p>“Who do you think you are?!” Two figures appeared in the hall the moment Huang Xiaolong was done speaking. </p>
			<p>The Blood Phoenix Queen was clad in a long crimson robe and the Titan King was tens of feet tall. His muscles were like dragons that coiled around his body and he emitted a terrifying aura. </p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, the Golden Cymbals King might have lost to you, but we’re no Golden Cymbals King. We might not be a match for you individually, but we’ll crush the Golden Cymbals King if we work together!” The Blood Phoenix Queen sneered. A ray of red light flickered in the space between her eyebrows.</p>
			<p>She wasn’t wrong. The two of them might not be as strong as the Golden Cymbals King on their own, but they were frighteningly powerful when they worked together.</p>
			<p>The Titan King appeared behind Huang Xiaolong before anyone could react and the Blood Phoenix Queen commenced her attack from the front.</p>
			<p>Ninth Void and the others retreated instantly as they were afraid that they would be caught in the crossfire. The battle that was about to take place wasn’t something they could take part in.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive and sighed, “Alright, show me what you got.”</p>
			<p>The two of them moved in unison as flames covered the Blood Phoenix Queen’s body. The Titan King locked on to Huang Xiaolong as he charged towards the puny human.</p>
			<p>The flames around the Blood Phoenix Queen were different from the divine flames that filled the universe. The flames were red like blood but it didn’t emit any sort of heat.</p>
			<p>That was how scary it was. It might not feel hot at all, but the moment her flames came into contact with her target, they would be incinerated to nothingness!</p>
			<p>The waves of energy around the Titan King were similar to that. They might seem harmless, but that was because the power was fully contained! </p>
			<p>Right before their attacks could arrive, Huang Xiaolong casually swung his hand. A pressure that held the weight of the universe came crashing down on the two of them.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3717: Location of the Universe Source Stone</p>
			</title>
			<p>When the two of them finally felt that something was wrong, they quickly summoned all their power to form a protective barrier around them.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>A wave of energy slammed into them right as they completed their defenses.</p>
			<p>The barrier shattered in an instant and it broke into a million pieces. The two of them were sent tumbling out countless miles as they smashed through several palaces on their way.</p>
			<p>Debris filled the land.</p>
			<p>Only after a long while did the rumbling stop.</p>
			<p>Ninth Void, Cong Dan, and the others looked at the two supreme experts of the Universe First Race who were sent flying by a ‘slave’ of the Human Race.</p>
			<p>The Thirteen Kings were the pillars of the Universe First Race, and it had been that way since the start of time!</p>
			<p>Now, the ranked seventh and eighth among them were easily swept away by a Human! </p>
			<p>The scene smashed heavily into the hearts of everyone present.</p>
			<p>“Daddy, Mommy!” Qing Luan cried out in fright when she looked at the two of them.</p>
			<p>Standing where he was, Huang Xiaolong didn’t press the attack. He looked at the two of them and sighed, “I know that the two of you have a special combined attack called the Earth Prison where the Phoenix Waltz. Go ahead and use it.”</p>
			<p>Dust filled the air as the two of them soared into the skies.</p>
			<p>They stared at Huang Xiaolong, dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>According to the Golden Cymbals King, Huang Xiaolong only managed to defeat him by drawing the battle out. He relied on the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, and Three Gods Halberd. When he sent them flying earlier, he didn’t use a single one of them!</p>
			<p>The strength that he displayed earlier had crossed the 27 billion mark that was described by the Golden Cymbals King!</p>
			<p>Their expressions finally turned serious.</p>
			<p>“Who would have thought that you would have broken through?” Blood Phoenix Queen screeched.</p>
			<p>“Even so, we’ll be able to suppress you!” The Titan King no longer held back as he released his aura completely.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s increase in strength might be unexpected, but the two of them were confident that they could take him down. After all, they were stronger than the Golden Cymbals King when they worked together!</p>
			<p>Moreover, their strength increased quite a bit in recent years…</p>
			<p>As the earthy light expanded around the Titan King, a pair of blood-red wings appeared behind the Blood Phoenix Queen. She grabbed him as they flew into the skies as their auras started to intertwine.</p>
			<p>The fire around Blood Phoenix Queen that could incinerate everything in her path fused seamlessly with the earth aura from the Titan King. </p>
			<p>The light that surrounded them started to transform and it burned a bright stinging yellow.</p>
			<p>The weird light seemed to contain all the colors of the universe and in the distance, the two looked like they were dancing in mid-air! They were flying above a cage formed by the mysterious light and their power charged at Huang Xiaolong in an instant.</p>
			<p>Their strength was far from what it was before. The combination of the two wasn’t a simple addition. </p>
			<p>Even Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when faced with their powerful strike.</p>
			<p>Ordinarily, the fire was an element that couldn’t fuse perfectly with anything. Now, the two of them proved Huang Xiaolong wrong.</p>
			<p>One had to know that such a perfect fusion was something nearly impossible. Especially, after they reached a level as high as that of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King. They were far too strong and the energies they had should be completely incompatible with each other. However, they proved the universe wrong.</p>
			<p>When Ninth Void and the others noticed the power coming from the couple, their jaws dropped in fright.</p>
			<p>“Can the two of them really defeat Huang Xiaolong?” Cong Dan gasped.</p>
			<p>“My parents will definitely be able to defeat that slave!” Qing Luan snorted.</p>
			<p>When the storm of energy arrived before Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hold back to unleash all 29.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p>The moment he did, the world seemed to stop moving. The city trembled as the skies shook. The powerful attack from the couple stopped right before it could crash into Huang Xiaolong and it was forced to stay ten feet away from him.</p>
			<p>The two of them looked at Huang Xiaolong with terror in their eyes.</p>
			<p>“This…” Only one other person emitted such a frightening aura.</p>
			<p>The Black Nether King!</p>
			<p>They only felt this way when they faced the Black Nether King!</p>
			<p>Could Huang Xiaolong have already reached that level?!</p>
			<p>Ninth Void and the others couldn’t believe what they were seeing and their bodies started to tremble.</p>
			<p>Stepping into the void, every step Huang Xiaolong took seemed to resonate in the hearts of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King. They retreated step by step, but they realized that their bodies no longer listened to them.𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝘯𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong tore through the energy storm as he made his way towards them.</p>
			<p>Standing before the couple, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand slightly to disperse any sort of energy surrounding them. Grabbing them by the neck, he dragged them towards himself. </p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>An hour later…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong left Blue Phoenix City with Pangu.</p>
			<p>This time, he didn’t use any effort to control the Blood Phoenix Queen, Titan King, and a bunch of experts from the city.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong learned about the White Feather King’s whereabouts from Ninth Void.</p>
			<p>“White Deer Cave!” </p>
			<p>That was where the White Feather King went towards.</p>
			<p>The White Deer King was an existence similar to a black hole in the universes. It was an extremely mysterious land, and it was one of the places even Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to step into in the past.</p>
			<p>It seemed as though the Universe Source Stone was located there!</p>
			<p>Several months later, Huang Xiaolong left the Universe Vault and headed straight towards the White Deer Cave. No matter what happened, he had to locate the stone before the White Feather King!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3718: A Fourteenth Universe Treasure?</p>
			</title>
			<p>As he made his way towards the White Deer Cave, he sent Pangu to somewhere safe. After all, Pangu’s presence would make challenging the White Feather King much more difficult.</p>
			<p>When he sent Pangu to a safe spot, he asked his master to return to the World of Departed Souls in the Blazing Dragon World. He also told him to remain there in case the Universe First Race came looking for slaves again. If Pangu traveled the world like he used to, he might be captured and sent back.</p>
			<p>The White Deer Cave was extremely distant. Even with the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong took an entire year to arrive.</p>
			<p>He was shocked to discover that there were plenty of experts charging towards the White Deer Cave. Most of them were experts from hidden ancient races.</p>
			<p>Their races were mostly born along with the Thirteen Universes, and they were created slightly later than the Universe First Race at best.</p>
			<p>All of them had remained in hiding all this whole. Even when Huang Xiaolong toured the universes, he failed to locate their presence. He only learned of them when he spoke to the Dragon Overlord and the others in the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>In the past, the Universe First Race called upon the first Extermination Tribulation. The Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen weren’t the only ones who managed to survive. There were several hidden experts who managed to live.</p>
			<p>The old ancestors of the races were those who had broken through the 20 billion mark!</p>
			<p>In the past, the Ferocious Devil said that he was afraid of two supreme existences in the Thirteen Universes before it was destroyed for the first time. One of them was the Black Nether King, but the second wasn’t the White Feather King! The White Feather King might be as strong as him, but he wouldn’t be afraid of someone he could challenge one-on-one! </p>
			<p>The other person was the Old Man Fortune!</p>
			<p>He was the old ancestor of the Fortune Race, and he outclassed even the Ferocious Devil! He might not be as strong as the Black Nether King, but he was an existence who could beat the Ferocious Devil anytime he wished!</p>
			<p>The Ferocious Devil’s combat strength neared the 29.9 billion mark, and Old Man Fortune was above him! One could say that other than the Black Nether King, he was the only other person closest to the Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong slowly approached the White Deer Cave despite his shock.</p>
			<p>“Fellow Cultivator, did something happen in the White Deer Cave to draw over too many experts from the hidden races?” Huang Xiaolong asked someone in his way.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could recognize the other party as an expert from the Yang Lightning Race due to the energy fluctuations around his body.</p>
			<p>Like the Fortune Race, the Yang Lightning Race was one of the earliest races to exist in the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>When the person he addressed turned around to look at him, he was shocked to discover that he couldn’t feel Huang Xiaolong’s aura.</p>
			<p>“Didn’t you hear? An absolute treasure was born in the White Deer Cave! It’s said that a universe treasure was born there.”</p>
			<p>“Universe treasure?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped. “Aren’t there only thirteen universe treasures?”</p>
			<p>“Since the creation of the Thirteen Universes, there have only been thirteen universe treasures. However, no one can say for certain that another universe treasure will never be born!”</p>
			<p>“I heard that the fourteenth universe treasure has appeared in the White Deer Cave!” </p>
			<p>However, he shook his head slowly and sighed, “Perhaps it’s just a rumor. I personally do not believe that the fourteenth universe treasure is about to be born.”</p>
			<p>Even so, he wished to satisfy his curiosity. </p>
			<p>Naturally, greed had a part to play in it.</p>
			<p>Those who came to the White Deer Cave didn’t do so because they were merely curious. </p>
			<p>Everyone would want to obtain a universe treasure for themselves.</p>
			<p>After thinking about it for some time, Huang Xiaolong made a bold guess. There might not be a fourteenth universe treasure, but they might be talking about the Universe Source Stone.</p>
			<p>After all, it was quite impossible for another universe treasure to spawn. If there really was a chance for the fourteenth universe treasure to appear, it would have done so countless years ago.</p>
			<p>“I am the ancient ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race, Yang Dingsheng. May I know who you are?” The expert cupped his fists and asked.</p>
			<p>For races that were as ancient as theirs, there was another rank for experts of their race. Instead of calling them doyens, they were called ancient ancestors.</p>
			<p>Their strength was nothing to scoff at. From what Huang Xiaolong could see, Yang Dingsheng was comparable to Wu Xin, the Limitless Master of the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>“I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide his identity.</p>
			<p>Visible shock flashed across Yang Dingsheng’s face. “You… You’re the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor, Huang Xiaolong?!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s feat of crushing the various alliances and the Creation Palace in the First Universe had long since spread through the universes. He established the Blue Dragon Manor after, solidifying his position as the strongest in the lands! As such, his name reached the ears of many hidden races.</p>
			<p>“That’s me. The Blue Dragon Manor is only a small existence in the universe. I can’t compare to fellow cultivator’s Yang Lightning Race…”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng chuckled, “You’re too humble.”</p>
			<p>Even though there were countless experts in the First Universe, Huang Xiaolong was the only one who managed to cross the 10 billion units mark. As such, none of the ancient ancestors could be bothered with him. To them, he was merely an ant.</p>
			<p>According to their investigation, Huang Xiaolong would accumulate 15 billion units of grand cosmos energy at best.𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝑒𝒷𝓃𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p>Soon after, Huang Xiaolong entered the White Deer Cave with Yang Dingsheng.</p>
			<p>As soon as they entered, darkness enveloped the lands. However, the darkness was nothing to experts at their level.</p>
			<p>The White Deer Cave wasn’t as barren as everyone thought. It was filled with signs of life and it slightly resembled the Universe Vault. The only difference was the feeling it gave off. The White Deer Cave seemed extremely bleak. </p>
			<p>As the two of them flew, they chatted with each other. The two of them hit it off immediately and they seemed like old friends after half a day of traveling together.</p>
			<p>“There’s no need for me to hide this from you. I’m not just here for the rumored universe treasure. I’m here for something else,” Yang Dingsheng sighed and said.</p>
			<p>Even though it had only been half a day, the two of them were calling each other brothers.</p>
			<p>“Oh? What is Brother Dingsheng looking for?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>“I’m looking for the White Deer!”</p>
			<p>“White Deer?!” </p>
			<p>The reason behind the name of the White Deer Cave was because of the legendary White Deer that lived in it. It was said to be born with the Rebirth Bloodline and it was created from the purest form of energy from the universes!</p>
			<p>Its bloodline had the ability to regenerate any wound one might suffer!</p>
			<p>However, the number of people who had seen the White Deer could probably be counted on one hand.</p>
			<p>“That’s right…” Yang Dingsheng sighed.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3719: Dazzling Black Race</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Why do you need to locate the White Deer?” Huang Xiaolong asked. “The White Deer isn’t a creature you can meet as you wish. Even if you did run into it, you might not be able to capture it.”</p>
			<p>If one could find the White Deer easily, a lot more people would have seen it.</p>
			<p>Also, there wasn’t anyone who could capture the creature.</p>
			<p>Experts from the Universe First Race tried time and time again, only to return empty-handed every time.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng’s voice turned sullen, and he sighed, “My wife was seriously injured by someone in the past. Her physical body was shattered and her dao heart was destroyed. Not even her dao soul could remain intact.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. That would make her no different from a corpse!</p>
			<p>“All these years, I tried countless ways to save her… I heard that the bloodline of the White Deer has the ability of rebirth and I’m here to try that.”</p>
			<p>Even though he knew that the chances of locating the White Deer were slim to none, he wanted to try his luck.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could tell how much he loved his wife, and he clapped Yang Dingsheng’s shoulder and comforted, “Brother Yang, you can rest assured that I’ll follow you on your journey to locate the White Deer. We’ll definitely be able to find it.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think about his wives. The figures of Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others flashed through his mind.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng revealed a comforted look and thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, I am extremely heartened by your intentions. However, looking for the White Deer won’t be easy. I do not wish to distract you.”</p>
			<p>“It’s alright. Even if we have to turn the White Deer Cave upside down, we’ll find it. It won’t take long for us to look through the entire area anyway.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hands casually.</p>
			<p>That was an exaggeration. The White Deer Cave was massive and it was comparable to the Universe Vault in size. It wouldn’t be easy to look through the entire area.</p>
			<p>Not to mention the fact that they might not locate the White Deer. The Universe First Race turned the place upside down in the past but failed to see its shadow! It wasn’t an object that would remain quietly in place for someone to find it. The White Deer could escape to any corner of the White Deer Cave in order to escape detection!</p>
			<p>The White Deer’s strength was also known to the universes. It was no weakling! It was basically unbeatable as long as they remained in the White Deer Cave!</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng felt a trace of hope burning in his heart after hearing what Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>“Oh? Isn’t this old man Yang Dingsheng?” A voice rang through the skies.</p>
			<p>Even though he wasn’t loud, his voice was extremely annoying to the ears.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong turned around to see three figures soaring across the skies as they rode on demonic beasts.</p>
			<p>The demonic beasts were called Black Demons and they were extremely terrifying existences. They were born with the ability to control darkness, and their speed when traveling in the dark was faster than anyone could imagine.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed slightly when he saw the newcomers.</p>
			<p>“They’re from the Dazzling Black Race.” </p>
			<p>The three of them quickly arrived before the duo.</p>
			<p>“Yang Dingsheng, are you also here for the fourteenth universe treasure?” The person in the lead sneered, “The old ancestor and patriarch of your race didn’t come because they know their place. You should know better as an ancient ancestor of your race! You better leave this place when you can and run back to your Yang Lightning Race… If a fight breaks out, I might cripple you with a single punch!” </p>
			<p>The two experts behind him roared with laughter.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face but a hand held him back when he wanted to approach the three. Yang Dingsheng shook his head slowly.</p>
			<p>“Brat, what do you think you’re doing?” The middle-aged man leading the trio snorted when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s actions.</p>
			<p>Cupping his fists, Yang Dingsheng sighed, “Brother Huang failed to recognize Brother Cao Cheng. I hope you can forgive him.” </p>
			<p>Cao Cheng tilted his head upwards and sneered, “Brat, I’ll forgive you because of Yang Dingsheng. If this happens again, I’ll cripple you!” </p>
			<p>After he spoke, he tore through the air with the two experts following behind him.</p>
			<p>After Cao Cheng had left, Yang Dingsheng heaved a sigh of relief and explained, “Brother Huang, you were too rash.”</p>
			<p>“It’s just the Dazzling Black Race… They’re nothing but ants.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>A bitter smile appeared on Yang Dingsheng’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You probably don’t know them. You should know that they remained hidden for a long time. Not many people in the Thirteen Universes know about them. The ancient ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race is an expert with 25 billion units of combat strength!” </p>
			<p>“Even if the old ancestor of our race meets the old ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race, he will have to lower his head. Cao Cheng is an expert who has broken through the 20 billion mark and I won’t be able to protect you if he makes a move on you!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the serious look on Yang Dingsheng’s face. “Is that so? If you didn’t hold me back, I would have crippled him with a single punch.”</p>
			<p>With his eyes widening in shock, Yang Dingsheng shook his head. “Alright, let’s go take a look. We’ll go look for the White Deer. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to find the treasure too!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. </p>
			<p>The two of them traveled deeper into the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle. As they went deeper, Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls in order to look for the White Feather King and the Universe Source Stone.</p>
			<p>As the Universe Source Stone was created during the formation of the universes, not even people like the Ferocious Devil or the White Feather King would be able to detect it easily. Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he had the Universe Boat, Nameless Devil Mirror, and the Universe Transformation Art. It was much easier for him to detect traces of the Universe Source Stone.</p>
			<p>Several dozen days passed in an instant.𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝗯𝐧𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>The only creatures they ran into were the monsters that lived in the White Deer Cave. With their strength, they dealt with the threat easily. </p>
			<p>Other than the creatures, they ran into several experts who were there to search for the treasure. As Yang Dingsheng knew all of them, no fights broke out. Everyone went their separate ways.</p>
			<p>When they saw a giant continent floating in the space before them, Yang Dingsheng suggested, “Brother Huang, let’s go take a look.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded and the two of them flew towards the land mass. Even with his dao souls, he couldn’t detect the end of it.</p>
			<p>The moment he stepped foot onto the continent, Huang Xiaolong felt a strange feeling that came from deep within the land.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng might not be able to discover the strangeness of the continent, but Huang Xiaolong was an existence close to the Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>They slowly made their way forward.</p>
			<p>“Strange… There are many fierce creatures in the other parts of the White Deer Cave. Why isn’t there a single one here?” Yang Dingsheng asked.</p>
			<p>A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Probably because it’s the territory of some terrifying existence.”</p>
			<p>?!</p>
			<p>Taking out a spiritual vein from the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong allowed it to hover in the air before him.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3720: Appearance of the White Deer</p>
			</title>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng gasped in fright when he saw the spiritual vein Huang Xiaolong retrieved. “That… That’s a Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life!” </p>
			<p>Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life! It was a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein, and it was something that would hardly appear in the outside world! Since the start of time, it was said that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life had only appeared twice! With the one Huang Xiaolong had brought out, it would appear for the third time in the Thirteen Universes!</p>
			<p>“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stole hundreds of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins from the Star Refinement King previously. Even though he used a large part of it, there were nearly a hundred left. The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was one of the rarest of those left.</p>
			<p>As an ancient existence, Yang Dingsheng might have been through a lot. Even so, his heart failed to remain calm when he saw the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life. After all, the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was similar to the bloodline of the White Deer! It had the ability to cure any injuries!</p>
			<p>The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life would be equally as useful to treat his wife’s injuries.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong knew what he was thinking about and muttered, “Brother Yang, even though the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life might be useful in treating her injuries, it’s not a solution.”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng snapped back to reality and sighed to himself.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was right. Even with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, he wouldn’t be able to completely heal her dao soul. The only way to save her was to subdue the White Deer. </p>
			<p>Using his grand cosmos energy, Huang Xiaolong forced the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life to emit boundless energy. The radiance that came from the spiritual vein contained the power of life and it pierced straight through the continent.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng was shocked to discover what Huang Xiaolong was doing. However, he soon managed to guess his intention. A wave of gratefulness swept through his heart.</p>
			<p>As the power of life spread through the lands, every single inch of land glowed a faint white.</p>
			<p>Half an hour passed quickly.</p>
			<p>Even though the power of life spread through the lands, everything remained as silent as could be.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng slowly started to panic.</p>
			<p>In contrast, Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive.𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p>An hour passed…</p>
			<p>A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as there wasn’t a single reaction from the creature in the land.</p>
			<p>Was he wrong?</p>
			<p>Increasing the intensity of his grand cosmos energy, even stronger waves of life filled the land. A slight buzzing sound could be heard as the rays of light sank deep into the continent.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s control of his energy was too precise. The energy waves didn’t leak out from the continent to the rest of the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>He didn’t wish to alert the experts who came to the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>Otherwise, everyone would charge over in an attempt to steal his spiritual vein!</p>
			<p>Not too long after Huang Xiaolong increased the intensity of his grand cosmos energy, a tiny little deer appeared in the distance and it walked towards them!</p>
			<p>It looked extremely docile, and it glowed with a faint white light. </p>
			<p>There were two little horns on its head, and they shone with a brilliant light. </p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng was extremely shocked to discover its arrival. Right before he could approach the deer, Huang Xiaolong reached out to stop him. </p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng knew what Huang Xiaolong’s intention was, and he hesitated slightly. Eventually, he chose to remain still.</p>
			<p>The White Deer glanced at Yang Dingsheng casually, but there was an unmistakable look of contempt in its eyes. It looked at Yang Dingsheng as though he was nothing more than an ant.</p>
			<p>Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, a look of visible confusion appeared in its eyes. It tried to see through Huang Xiaolong and a solemn expression soon appeared on its face.</p>
			<p>“You’re pretty strong…” An enchanting voice left the White Deer’s lips.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng turned to look at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. How could someone with only 15 billion units of combat strength be considered pretty strong?</p>
			<p>“Were you planning on capturing me by luring me all the way out here with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life? You might be strong, but you’re dreaming if you think that you can capture me.” </p>
			<p>One had to admit that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was extremely tempting even for the White Deer. Even though it knew that Huang Xiaolong was planning to lure it out, it came out nonetheless.</p>
			<p>“That’s right. I planned to lure you out here with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, but my intention isn’t to capture you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I wish to make a deal with you.”</p>
			<p>“A deal?” A ray of light flashed through the White Deer’s eyes, and it continued, “What do you propose?” </p>
			<p>“I hope you can save someone for me. Also, I wish to know the whereabouts of the Universe Source Stone.”</p>
			<p>Since the Universe Source Stone was located in the White Deer Cave, the White Deer probably knew its whereabouts. That was the main reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s desire to draw it out.”</p>
			<p>“How do you know about the Universe Source Stone?!” The White Deer gasped in shock as it looked at Huang Xiaolong with a renewed sense of caution.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng was equally as surprised.</p>
			<p>Is there really a piece of Universe Source Stone located in the White Deer Cave?!</p>
			<p>“That’s right. As long as you agree to my conditions, I’ll give you the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.</p>
			<p>A grin that resembled that of a human appeared on the White Deer’s face. “You’re right. I do know where the Universe Source Stone is. However, do you really think that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life is enough to trade for information on it?” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all as he retrieved another Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life from the Universe Boat. “What if I add another?” </p>
			<p>The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.</p>
			<p>Two strands of Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life!</p>
			<p>The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life only appeared twice in the history of the Thirteen Universes. However, the youngster standing before it brought out two other strands!</p>
			<p>A look of disbelief could be seen on Yang Dingsheng’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>After snapping back to reality, the White Deer shook its head. “No. That’s still not enough.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong silently retrieved another spiritual vein from the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>The spiritual vein that appeared was slightly different from the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, but it emitted dense waves of life energy.</p>
			<p>“White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein!” Yang Dingsheng gasped.</p>
			<p>The White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein was at the same level as the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life. </p>

				<p>Chapter 3721: Black Source Ice</p>
			</title>
			<p>The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong as confusion flashed through its eyes. It didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would possess so many treasures.</p>
			<p>“That’s still far from enough to trade for information on the Universe Source Stone.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong brought out another White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng felt his legs going soft.</p>
			<p>“Another one?!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong not only possessed two Radiant Spiritual Veins of Life. He also had two strands of White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Veins! How in the world did he obtain so many of them?!𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝓌ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng wouldn’t dare to think that Huang Xiaolong managed to grab them all by robbing the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>If he learned about it, he might question his whole existence.</p>
			<p>“Nope.” The White Deer sighed. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong took out two other spiritual veins.</p>
			<p>This time, it was the Angelic Light Spiritual Vein.</p>
			<p>“Angelic Light Spiritual Vein?!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.</p>
			<p>Of course, it was of a similar rarity as the two spiritual veins before.</p>
			<p>“Not enough!”</p>
			<p>“Nine Sun Dragon Zoysia Spiritual Vein!”</p>
			<p>“Not enough!”</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>“Heavenly Genesis Spiritual Vein!”</p>
			<p>After Huang Xiaolong brought out more than eight spiritual veins at the same level as that of the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, everyone stared at him in shock.</p>
			<p>The White Deer looked at Huang Xiaolong silently. It was obvious that it was tempted by Huang Xiaolong’s offer.</p>
			<p>After all, those were no ordinary universe-level spiritual veins!</p>
			<p>“How did you manage to obtain so many top-grade spiritual veins?” The White Deer asked.</p>
			<p>“You don’t need to worry about that,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Saving someone is nothing but a slight inconvenience to you. I only wish to learn of the location of the Universe Source Stone. I’m not asking you to give it to me. It won’t be easy for me to obtain it either.”</p>
			<p>Weird light flashed in the White Deer’s eyes. It was true. Obtaining the Universe Source Stone wasn’t easy! After all, it knew where the stone was. Even after all these years, it failed to obtain it.</p>
			<p>As such, the Universe Source Stone was nothing more than decoration to the White Deer.</p>
			<p>“Alright. I agree.”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng jumped with joy when he heard what it said. Turning to Huang Xiaolong, tears of gratitude streamed down his face. “Thank you. Thank you, Brother Huang!”</p>
			<p>The White Deer rolled its eyes when it saw Yang Dingsheng’s reaction. “Brat, why aren’t you thanking me? Don’t forget, I’m the one doing the saving. From the looks of it, you probably wish to save someone close to you, right?”</p>
			<p>Turning to the White Deer, Yang Dingsheng thanked profusely, “Many thanks to Senior White Deer!”</p>
			<p>“Call me Lord White Deer!”</p>
			<p>“Yes… I should. Many thanks to Lord White Deer.” Yang Dingsheng changed his address immediately. He knew that the White Deer was a pinnacle existence in the Thirteen Universes. He didn’t think that it was weird as monsters at their level had some weird temperament.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong watched as the White Deer retrieved the universe-level spiritual veins and said, “Since we’re done here, bring me to the Universe Source Stone.”</p>
			<p>The Universe Source Stone was an item that could secure the future of the Thirteen Universes. It was of utmost importance that Huang Xiaolong obtained it in order to stop the destruction.</p>
			<p>“Relax. The location of the Universe Source Stone is extremely secret. No one other than me knows of its location,” The White Deer muttered when it saw the anxious expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “However, you’re not allowed to resent me when you fail to obtain the Universe Source Stone. I can only tell you its location.”</p>
			<p>“Yeah. Getting it is my problem.” Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Lead the way.”</p>
			<p>Without wasting any more time, the White Deer brought Huang Xiaolong towards the depths of the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>A month passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>As the three of them traveled deeper and deeper into the White Deer Cave, Huang Xiaolong chatted happily with Yang Dingsheng. They were the only ones talking and when it came to Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer, the conversation became stale.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong discovered that the surroundings were getting quieter and quieter as they went deeper into the cave.</p>
			<p>After another month, the White Deer finally stopped.</p>
			<p>There wasn’t anywhere else to go!</p>
			<p>A giant wall stood before the trio, and it was formed completely with black ice. No one knew how thick the wall of black ice was, but it extended infinitely.</p>
			<p>“This is a wall of Black Source Ice!” The White Deer explained.</p>
			<p>“Universe Black Source Ice?!” Yang Dingsheng sucked in a cold breath.</p>
			<p>The Black Source Ice was the most terrifying source of frost in the Thirteen Universes. Even if half-step Universe Gods touched a little bit of it, they would turn into a statue of ice.</p>
			<p>“That’s right. It’s Black Source Ice.” A complicated look could be seen on the White Deer’s face.</p>
			<p>“Is the Universe Source Stone sealed within?!” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.</p>
			<p>“Yes. Even though I can’t see it, I can tell that it’s in there. As the owner of the White Deer Cave, nothing escapes from my detection.” However, it shook its head soon after. “It’s too bad that I can’t tear open the wall of Black Source Ice…”</p>
			<p>Even though it was the owner of the White Deer Cave and a pinnacle existence in the Thirteen Universes, it was unable to shatter the wall of Black Source Ice.</p>
			<p>“How deep is it hidden?” Huang Xiaolong asked. </p>
			<p>“Probably a hundred thousand miles.” The White Deer sighed.</p>
			<p>“A hundred thousand miles?!” Yang Dingsheng gasped in fright.</p>
			<p>There wasn’t a need to mention a hundred thousand miles. It wasn’t possible for them to break through a hundred feet!</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng looked at Huang Xiaolong and shook his head, “Brother Huang, why don’t we leave it at this?”</p>
			<p>“The Universe Origin Fires should be able to burn through the Black Source Ice, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.</p>
			<p>Both the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at him in shock.</p>
			<p>“Yeah, the Black Source Ice might be the source of all frost in the universes, but you should be able to… However, it’s not easy for you to obtain the Universe Origin Fires,” The White Deer explained.</p>
			<p>A brilliant ball of flame emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body as soon as the White Deer spoke.</p>
			<p>With their jaws dropping in fright, they stared at Huang Xiaolong like they were looking at a monster.</p>
			<p>“White Tiger Origin Fire?” The White Deer shook its head slowly. “Without the other fires, you probably won’t get far.”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3722: Appearance of the White Feathers King</p>
			</title>
			<p>The three other Universe Origin Fires emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body soon after.</p>
			<p>The moment they appeared, a terrifying sea of flames engulfed the lands. The thick wall of Black Source Ice started to melt in the face of the Universe Origin Fires.</p>
			<p>The liquid that came from the melted ice flooded the surroundings.</p>
			<p>Both the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at the melting ice and their eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p>
			<p>Roaring in disbelief, the White Deer raged, “Why didn’t you tell me that you had the Universe Origin Fires?!”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t tell me that the Universe Source Stone was stuck in a mountain of Black Source Ice.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.</p>
			<p>Looking at Huang Xiaolong silently, the White Deer could only blame itself.</p>
			<p>“Since I have the Universe Origin Fires, I should be able to obtain the Universe Source Stone, right?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression on its face. “You probably can…” There was a look of reluctance on its face when it saw the four Universe Origin Fires hovering around Huang Xiaolong. It had long since pined for the Universe Source Stone. There was no way it could remain calm as it watched such a precious treasure being taken away. </p>
			<p>After all, the Universe Source Stone was equally as useful to the White Deer.</p>
			<p>What if it made a move on Huang Xiaolong?</p>
			<p>The notion did indeed appear in its mind.</p>
			<p>However, the White Deer decided against it. It could tell that Huang Xiaolong was in no way weaker than it. Moreover, he had the four Universe Origin Fires. It wouldn’t be possible for it to obtain it from Huang Xiaolong anyway.</p>
			<p>After a short moment of hesitation, it asked, “I can trade you a little Universe Source Qi for the spiritual veins you handed over previously.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t lack universe-level spiritual veins…”</p>
			<p>“What do you want for some of the qi?! I have a lot of treasures from all my years of existence. Even though they aren’t as precious as the Universe Source Stone, they’re comparable to your spiritual veins”!</p>
			<p>As if it was afraid that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t agree, it quickly retrieved a spatial artifact and revealed its contents. Yang Dingsheng cried out loud when he saw what was contained within.</p>
			<p>“Golden Dragon Core!”</p>
			<p>“Heavenly Phoenix Flower!”</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>The treasures that could hardly be found in the outside world were piled high into a mountain.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong remained completely indifferent when he looked at the pile of treasures. “I have no need for any of those. However, I can agree to give you a little universe source qi if you agree to my conditions.”</p>
			<p>“What are they?!”</p>
			<p>“Be my mount,” Huang Xiaolong explained.</p>
			<p>“What?!” You!” A flash of rage crossed the White Deer’s eyes. It glared at Huang Xiaolong with the intention to kill the filthy human before it. After all, that request was nothing more than a way to humiliate the White Deer.</p>
			<p>The White Deer was the master of the White Deer Cave, and it was one of the peak existences in the Thirteen Universes. Not even the Black Nether King would dare to come up with a condition like that!</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng sucked in a cold breath as he didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would bring up such an outrageous condition. </p>
			<p>Wasn’t that a little…</p>
			<p>“There’s no need to look at me like that,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You can disagree if you like. However, it’s only a matter of time before I surpass the Black Nether King.”𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝒸𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Origin Fires to melt away layers upon layers of ice after he spoke. Very quickly, he disappeared into the hole he created.</p>
			<p>The White Deer felt its rage dissipating as it looked into the bottomless hole created by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>As for Yang Dingsheng, he didn’t think too much about it. He spoke to the White Deer, “Lord White Deer, you can ignore whatever he said. He didn’t mean to offend you.”</p>
			<p>The White Deer ignored him completely.</p>
			<p>Seeing the creature’s reaction, Yang Dingsheng felt a wave of anxiousness rising in his heart.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to penetrate several thousand feet into the ice. The deeper he went, the harder it became to melt the ice. As such, he had to slow down a little.</p>
			<p>After half an hour, he finally reached the ten thousand feet mark.</p>
			<p>As he traveled closer to the Universe Source Stone, a figure emerged outside the wall of ice. There was a holy aura surrounding his body, and his bloodline pulsated with the strength of the oldest bloodline in the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>“White Feather King!”</p>
			<p>The person who came was precisely the White Feather King of the Universe First Race.</p>
			<p>The White Deer was equally as shocked to discover his presence.</p>
			<p>The White Feather King glanced at Yang Dingsheng before turning to look at the White Deer. He evidently didn’t expect to see the White Deer and grinned, “White Deer, are you also here for the Universe Source Stone?”</p>
			<p>The White Deer stared at the item in the White Feather King’s hand and gasped in shock. Was that how he located the Universe Source Stone?!</p>
			<p>Perhaps it was how the Universe First Race obtained the first piece of Universe Source Stone in the past.</p>
			<p>Even though the White Deer had no idea what the round plate-like item in his hand was, it could tell that there was a special type of energy coming from it.</p>
			<p>“White Feather King, your Universe First Race is bound to be disappointed this time.” The White Deer sneered, “Even if you managed to locate this place, you won’t be able to grab the Universe Source Stone.” </p>
			<p>In the past, the Universe First Race sealed off the White Deer Cave in order to capture the White Deer and it had been holding a grudge ever since.</p>
			<p>A frown formed on the White Feather King’s face when he saw the wall of Black Source Ice. The White Deer wasn’t any weaker than it, but it failed to shatter the Black Source Ice! There was no way he could do the same.</p>
			<p>However, he could feel a wave of energy coming from deep within the wall of ice.</p>
			<p>Could it be?!</p>
			<p>Universe Origin Fire?!</p>
			<p>There was only one treasure in the universes that could melt the Black Source Ice!</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong?!” The White Feather King guessed the identity of the person in the Black Source Ice immediately. Huang Xiaolong’s possession of the Universe Origin Fires was no secret.</p>
			<p>When he learned who it was, a sinister laugh escaped his lips. “Little White Deer, Huang Xiaolong probably entered the wall of Black Source Ice… Looks like the heavens are helping my race! I might not be able to obtain the Universe Source Stone myself, but someone is bringing it out for me!”</p>
			<p>According to what the White Feather King knew, Huang Xiaolong was stuck at the 27 billion mark. When Huang Xiaolong emerged with the Universe Source Stone, he would snatch it away from the kid!</p>
			<p>As for the White Deer, he didn’t think too much about it. He brought a special treasure refined by the Black Nether King in order to suppress the White Deer. When that happened, the White Deer wouldn’t be able to stop him!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3723: Retrieving the Universe Source Stone</p>
			</title>
			<p>When the White Deer heard what White Feather King said, a wave of suspicion filled its heart. What the hell was he talking about? Why would Huang Xiaolong assist the Universe First Race in their quest to obtain the Universe Source Stone?! Is he someone from the Universe First Race?!</p>
			<p>As questions raced through the White Deer’s mind, Huang Xiaolong continued to dig deeper towards the Universe Source Stone. After several days, he finally arrived.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong saw a separate space within the wall of Black Source Ice that contained the Universe Source Stone. It was the size of a fist with countless facets. Resplendent light was emitted from every single angle, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though it contained the power that fueled the universes.</p>
			<p>Every single surface of the Universe Source Stone seemed to be a great world of its own! Huang Xiaolong felt the boundless power coursing through the stone.</p>
			<p>Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong tried to calm himself.</p>
			<p>The Universe Source Stone had far surpassed any universe-level spiritual vein he knew. No matter how many top-grade universe-level spiritual veins he obtained, he would never be able to replicate the energy contained in the Universe Source Stone.</p>
			<p>It was no wonder the Universe First Race wanted to use the Universe Source Stone as the eye of the formation. With the power contained in it, they would be truly able to activate the Extermination Formation! Only with the Universe Source Stone would they be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes and harvest all lives within!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong reached out slowly to grab the rock, but a wave of energy stopped him.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. “Are you thinking of resisting me?” </p>
			<p>A flash of light came from inside the Universe Source Stone as though it was challenging Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>He also felt like the Universe Source Stone was looking down on him.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter, “Even if you do not wish to follow me, you don’t have a choice! The Universe First Race was able to bring away your brother, and I’m more than capable of taking you with me today!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong released his grand cosmos energy before reaching for the rock.</p>
			<p>No matter how powerful the light it emitted, the Universe Source Stone realized that it wasn’t able to push Huang Xiaolong away! It could only watch as Huang Xiaolong’s hand arrived close to its surface. In a desperate attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong, it used everything it could, and Huang Xiaolong was forced to stop right before he could touch it.</p>
			<p>Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong increased the amount of power he used once again. In response, the Universe Source Stone did the same.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong increased his energy bit by bit, he was finally about to touch the Universe Source Stone when he released 29.9 billion units.</p>
			<p>A tsunami of energy emerged from the Universe Source Stone, pushing Huang Xiaolong away.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snickered when he realized that that was all the Universe Source Stone had. “I refuse to believe that you have much more left in you!”</p>
			<p>As soon as he spoke, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art and 29.9999 billion units of grand cosmos energy flooded towards the rock.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>The moment he used his full power, the entire space started to shatter. The Universe Source Stone trembled where it stood.</p>
			<p>The rays of light that came from the stone could no longer resist Huang Xiaolong, and he quickly grabbed the stone.</p>
			<p>Tossing it into the third level of restrictions on the Universe Boat instantly, Huang Xiaolong suppressed it.</p>
			<p>After he was done, he heaved a sigh of relief. When he returned, he would refine the Universe Source Stone slowly.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Origin Fires to cut a path towards the surface.</p>
			<p>It was much faster when he left, and it took him less than a day.</p>
			<p>When he emerged, he was greeted with the sight of the White Feather King.</p>
			<p>Before the White Deer could say anything, the White Feather King spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, hand over the Universe Source Stone, and I’ll spare your life today!”</p>
			<p>The White Deer was shocked.</p>
			<p>It thought that Huang Xiaolong was in cahoots with the Universe First Race, but it seemed to be mistaken.</p>
			<p>A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard what the White Feather King said. “Spare my life? White Feather King, do you really think that you’re strong enough to determine my fate? I remember the Golden Cymbals King saying the exact same thing back in the Netherworld of the Unknown Space, but I’m still alive and kicking. Didn’t he flee with his tails tucked between his legs?”</p>
			<p>“Golden Cymbals King? Hahaha, you must be mistaken. I’m no Golden Cymbals King!” The White Feather King looked at the White Deer and sneered, “Even if you work with this beast, you won’t be able to escape.”</p>
			<p>As the words left his lips, he retrieved a Black Ghost Spike that the Black Nether King refined.</p>
			<p>The Black Ghost Spike emitted dense rays of dark energy, and everyone could see how terrifying it was from a single glance. When they looked at it, they felt as though their souls were torn apart by horrifying beings.𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝔀𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p>The White Deer’s expression changed slightly.</p>
			<p>“The Ghost Spike is refined by the Black Nether King in order to suppress the White Deer.” The White Feather King grinned. “White Deer, you better not interfere with the matter between my race and Huang Xiaolong. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind unleashing its full strength on you.”</p>
			<p>A figure appeared beside the White Feather King when he spoke up to that point and in a state of shock, the White Feather King could only swing the spike out to protect himself.</p>
			<p>Clang!</p>
			<p>The Ghost Spike slammed into the wall that separated the White Deer Cave from the outside world and a punch landed on his chest. He was sent flying god knows how many miles away.</p>
			<p>When he finally stabilized himself, he looked at his chest where a terrifying dent could be seen. </p>
			<p>Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong in shock, he gasped, “You… How… How can you?!”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng was equally as stunned.</p>
			<p>The White Feather King of the Universe First Race was sent flying by a single punch from Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>According to the information they had, wasn’t Huang Xiaolong, the master of the Blue Dragon Manor, someone with only 15 billion units of combat strength?!</p>
			<p>“Are you curious as to my increase in strength?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “You can go back and ask the Golden Cymbals King when you return!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred once again as he appeared before the White Feather King. His fist came crashing down.</p>
			<p>A radiant staff appeared in the White Feather King’s hand and the power of radiance gushed out from it unceasingly.</p>
			<p>That was one of the thirteen universe treasures, the Radiant God Staff!</p>
			<p>The Ghost Staff appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand as it countered the Radiant God Staff.</p>
			<p>The White Feather King was forced to retreat once again.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3724: White Feather King, Who Would Have Thought</p>
			</title>
			<p>Ordinarily, the Radiant God Staff was more than capable of suppressing the Ghost Staff. However, everything was as the Golden Cymbals King said when he attacked Huang Xiaolong for the first time. No matter how strong one’s universe treasures were, it depended on the user! Huang Xiaolong was more than capable of suppressing the White Feather King alone, and the Ghost Staff was countless times more powerful in his hands!</p>
			<p>Once again, the White Feather King was forced to retreat.</p>
			<p>He felt his arms going numb as rage filled his mind.</p>
			<p>“White Feather King, who would have thought that you would be in such a sorry state…” The White Deer mocked from the side.</p>
			<p>It was more than happy to see the White Feather King being suppressed by Huang Xiaolong. The only thing that would make it happier was if Huang Xiaolong killed the White Feather King!</p>
			<p>Glaring at the White Deer in anger, the White Feather King aimed his Ghost Spike at the creature before stabbing straight at it. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi arrived the moment he made his move. He barely managed to dodge the wave of sword qi directed at him, but his hair wasn’t as lucky. A huge chunk of his hair was sliced away by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>When he got to his feet, he realized that there was a giant bald patch on his head.</p>
			<p>The White Deer laughed happily. “White Feather King, you should change your name to the Featherless King!”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you forced me to do this!” The White Feather King roared as a pair of white wings appeared behind him. </p>
			<p>His body started to expand as white feathers formed several layers over his skin.</p>
			<p>The feathers that covered him were no ordinary feathers. Every single one of them contained an extremely concentrated radiant energy and white flame surrounded them.</p>
			<p>It was a flame created after the power of radiance reached a certain level.</p>
			<p>A sea of white flames surrounded the White Feather King and it covered an area of several hundred million miles.</p>
			<p>The White Deer’s expression turned solemn when it noticed the power the White Feather King emitted. Like the White Feather King, it was able to control the power of radiance. It knew how terrifying the sea of flames was.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng escaped a long time ago. Even though his strength was comparable to the Limitless Master, he would turn to ash if he came into contact with the flames.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless as he faced the White Feather King who had gone all out. He activated all three great worlds in him as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art.</p>
			<p>The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, eat my radiant flame!” The White Feather King swung his Radiant God Staff once again as the sea of flames funneled towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A sneer left his lips as the Universe Origin Fires turned into a sea of flames that revolved around his body. The two blazing oceans crashed into each other. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s halberd went straight for the White Feather King’s chest. As the Three Gods Halberd swept outwards, the Black Source Ice that was behind him started to move.</p>
			<p>Layers upon layers of Black Source Ice formed a massive world that slammed into the White Feather King.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>When the two fiery oceans crashed into each other, a heaven-shaking explosion rang through the air.</p>
			<p>The Black Source Ice continued on its way towards the White Feather King.</p>
			<p>The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng could see that the White Feather King’s sea of radiant flames was completely suppressed after that one exchange.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong might not be able to destroy the sea of radiant flames with his strike with the Three Gods Halberd alone, but the Universe Origin Fires were the source of all fire in the universes! It suppressed the radiant flames and the Black Source Ice that came along with the halberd strike was more than enough to overwhelm the White Feather King!</p>
			<p>No one could deny the frightening power the Black Source Ice possessed! Not even the White Deer could melt the layers of ice to get the Universe Source Stone after countless years!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air once again and the Golden Sun Circlets appeared. It turned into a streak of light that flew straight towards the White Feather King.</p>
			<p>“Golden Sun Circlet?!” The White Feather King gasped as he twisted his body unnaturally. If he had moved a second later, he would have been struck in the chest. Even so, the circlet smashed straight into his right arm.</p>
			<p>The white feathers might possess the strongest defense in the Thirteen Universes, but the Golden Sun Circlet was a universe treasure! A huge chunk of feathers fell from his body.</p>
			<p>Sounds of shattering bones could be heard.</p>
			<p>He was enraged as anger clouded his mind. He hadn’t been injured in countless years! That was the first time he had suffered an injury, and it was at the hands of a mere human!</p>
			<p>“Huang-Xiao-Long!” His eyes turned completely red, and he gnashed his teeth together.</p>
			<p>The Radiant God Staff soared into the void above as endless radiance energy poured down towards them. As he absorbed the power of radiance, his injuries healed instantly.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. After all, the White Feather King was basically an existence similar to the White Deer. They could cure every single injury instantly.</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care too much as the Yin Yang Flame Wheels appeared under his feet. He appeared before the White Feather King as the Reversal Sword chopped downwards.</p>
			<p>As the sword slashed downwards, space and time reversed as the world seemed to return to its origin.</p>
			<p>In a desperate attempt to defend himself, the White Feather King raised the Radiant God Staff once again. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s sword was faster, and it went deep into his chest.</p>
			<p>More than an hour passed…</p>
			<p>Their battle lasted all the way, and the White Feather King had no idea how many injuries he sustained. Luckily for him, he was able to recover almost immediately after he was struck.</p>
			<p>Other people might not be able to tell, but Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer both knew that the White Feather King’s recovery speed was starting to slow down. </p>
			<p>Even though it looked to be the same, it was unmistakably slower than it once was.</p>
			<p>The White Feather King’s ability to control the power of radiance was unparalleled, but his strength was starting to decline after such a terrifying battle.</p>
			<p>Since the White Deer and Huang Xiaolong could tell, the White Feather King was naturally able to notice the condition of his body. He knew that if the battle carried on, it would be a matter of time before he lost.</p>
			<p>Stopping suddenly, the White Feather King glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, you made a wrong choice to oppose my Universe First Race! You’ll die a horrible death!”𝙛𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>“I should be the one saying that. Your Universe First Race will regret standing against me.”</p>
			<p>Killing intent burst out from the White Feather King’s eyes. “You can gloat for now, but Lord Black Nether will be out from seclusion before long. When he enters the Universe God Realm, everyone related to you will die!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Without the Universe Source Stone, do you really think that he can break through to the Universe God Realm?”</p>
			<p>The White Feather King felt the words getting stuck in his throat like a bone.</p>
			<p>However, he soon snorted, “Even if Lord Black Nether doesn’t break through, he can still kill you with a wave of his hand! He’ll break through even without the Universe Source Stone! Do you really think that you can stop our plans by snatching away a mere rock?!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sneered in response, “Without the Universe Source Stone, the Black Nether King will only be able to break through in several billion years. When that happens, I would have long since entered the Universe God Realm! If you choose to submit to me now, I’ll spare your life when the time comes!”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3725: Black Nether King’s Talent!</p>
			</title>
			<p>A mocking smile appeared on the White Feather King’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you’re comparable to Lord Black Nether? What a joke! Lord Black Nether is the first sentient spirit born during the start of time! Even Old Man Fortune was born later than Lord Black Nether!”</p>
			<p>“Lord Black Nether has thirteen supreme bloodlines, and every one of them is unparalleled in the Thirteen Universes!”</p>
			<p>“The first and only person who will enter the Universe God Realm is Lord Black Nether!”</p>
			<p>“How dare you sprout nonsense and challenge Lord Black Nether?!”</p>
			<p>The White Feather King continued, “Take a piss and look at your own reflection. Do you really think that you have fourteen supreme bloodlines or something?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt his heart palpitating when he heard what the White Feather King said. If that was true, the Black Nether King’s bloodline was definitely unparalleled.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had never heard of anyone who could possess thirteen supreme bloodlines before!</p>
			<p>Not even the Ferocious Devil and the others knew about that!</p>
			<p>The White Deer’s eyes turned wide, and it was evident that it was the first time it was hearing anything of the like. There wasn’t a need to mention Yang Dingsheng. He felt the world spinning around him. </p>
			<p>“Even if he has thirteen supreme bloodlines, it doesn’t mean a thing. He might have thirteen bloodlines, but that doesn’t mean he’s the most talented person in the Thirteen Universes.” Huang Xiaolong quickly regained his calm.</p>
			<p>Laughter boomed through the air when the White Feather King heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Hahaha! Do you really think that you’re more talented than Lord Black Nether?!”</p>
			<p>“How long has he been cultivating for? Since the start of time, your Black Nether King has been striving to break through. However, I haven’t even lived past the one hundred million years mark.”</p>
			<p>“What?!” The White Feather King, White Deer, and Yang Dingsheng yelled in fright.</p>
			<p>“Not even a hundred million years?!” The White Feather King couldn’t believe his ears.</p>
			<p>“That’s right.”</p>
			<p>In fact, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even cultivated for more than twenty million years!</p>
			<p>From the time he spent in the mortal world up to his current realm, Huang Xiaolong spent slightly more than ten million years!</p>
			<p>“That’s not possible!” The White Feather King sneered. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that we’ll believe your lies? It’s not possible for someone to reach your level in less than a hundred million years!”</p>
			<p>“Hand over the Universe Source Stone to us! In the future, Lord Black Nether will allow you to become the fourteenth king of our Universe First Race!” The White Feather King sneered.</p>
			<p>Before anyone could react, a branch of the Star Dragon Divine Tree sent him flying.</p>
			<p>There was nowhere for him to run as the branches covered countless miles above him. After flying for countless miles, a light surrounded his body as he disappeared into thin air.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, in the future, Lord Black Nether will personally appear to take care of you! You’re dead!” The White Feather King’s voice descended from the void.</p>
			<p>“I’ll be waiting,” Huang Xiaolong replied impassively.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother chasing the man. After all, he wouldn’t be able to suppress the White Feather King anyway.</p>
			<p>Like the Golden Cymbals King and Heaven Devouring King, the Star Dragon Divine Tree couldn’t stop them when they escaped.</p>
			<p>The White Deer looked at Huang Xiaolong and sighed, “Who would have thought that the Black Nether King would possess thirteen supreme bloodlines?! He should be the first existence who would ever break into the Universe God Realm!”</p>
			<p>When that happened, no one would be able to avoid destruction. </p>
			<p>The White Deer’s fate would be the same.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Relax. Since they don’t have the Universe Source Stone, I’ll be able to break through before the Black Nether King.”</p>
			<p>The White Deer shook its head silently when it looked at Huang Xiaolong. It was evident that it didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would break through before the Black Nether King.</p>
			<p>“It’s not as easy as you think.” The White Deer sighed. “The Black Nether King has unparalleled talent and unlimited support from the Universe First Race. Even so, he failed to break through last time.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the White Deer any longer. After all, he wasn’t planning to explain himself.</p>
			<p>“Brother Yang, let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yang Dingsheng who had been stuck in a daze since the White Feather King left.</p>
			<p>Snapping back to reality, he stuttered, “Senior… Senior Huang, I…”</p>
			<p>“Nonsense, there’s no need to address me as your senior.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Our relationship will remain the same until the end of time!”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed slightly, but he eventually nodded his head.</p>
			<p>Finally, the two of them charged towards the entrance with the White Deer following closely behind. Yang Dingsheng was initially wary of Huang Xiaolong, but as the days passed, he started to open up. Like before, laughter filled the air.</p>
			<p>“Brother Huang, I never would have thought that the White Feather King would be no match for you!” Yang Dingsheng exclaimed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong laughed in response, “I only managed to get lucky by bringing more universe treasures with me…”</p>
			<p>“Even if you didn't, the White Feather King wouldn’t be a match for you…” The White Deer sneered at the side.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled, but he didn’t dismiss the fact.</p>
			<p>“However, the distance between the Black Nether King and yourself is still infinitely large. In fact, Old Man Fortune might even be stronger than you,” The White Deer explained.</p>
			<p>“Oh? Is Old Man Fortune really so strong?”</p>
			<p>“Yeah. He’s extremely strong. The Black Nether King might be strong, but he’s still wary of Old Man Fortune. Old Man Fortune is the only reason the Universe First Race didn’t dare to touch the Fortune Space when they destroyed the universes the first time!”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng explained further, “The Fortune Space is the place created by Old Man Fortune. The oldest races in the Thirteen Universes reside there.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Now that you say that, I’m really looking forward to meeting Old Man Fortune.”</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng gasped.</p>
			<p>The White Deer laughed. “You better get rid of that stupid idea…”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong snorted and ignored them both.</p>
			<p>Right as they were about to leave the White Deer Cave for the Yang Lightning Race, a shocking power emerged from the depths of the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>“This?!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.</p>
			<p>The three of them noticed that a ton of experts were rushing towards the source of the fluctuations.𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝒃𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>“Did the fourteenth universe treasure appear?” Yang Dingsheng asked.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the White Deer for an answer. After all, the White Deer was the owner of the space.</p>
			<p>“I have no idea…”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3726: Golden Phoenix Crown Prince</p>
			</title>
			<p>“You don’t know?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.</p>
			<p>The White Deer snorted in response. “I might be the owner of the White Deer Space, but do you think I’m god?! How am I supposed to know everything that happens here?”</p>
			<p>“Should we go take a look?” Yang Dingsheng asked cautiously.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong saw the look of anticipation on Yang Dingsheng’s face, he chuckled, “Alright… let’s go take a look.”</p>
			<p>He knew that Yang Dingsheng was afraid that the two would break out into a massive brawl if their argument got any worse.</p>
			<p>If that were to happen, he might not be able to save his wife!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong knew exactly how Yang Dingsheng felt.</p>
			<p>As such, the three of them flew casually over to the source of the energy fluctuations.</p>
			<p>After half an hour, they saw a massive continent floating in midair. The continent was comparable to the one where Huang Xiaolong found the White Deer, but there were strange white creatures growing all over the land. </p>
			<p>The White Deer Cave was an eerie place, and everything they saw was black. There wasn’t a single speck of white throughout their journey, but an entire continent was now covered in it!</p>
			<p>The grass was white, the stones were white, and even the river that flowed in the land was white in color!</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng was equally as surprised.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the White Deer only to be greeted by a confused look. “How in the world did these things turn white?” It hadn’t left the White Deer Cave for a long time and it knew everything that happened in the lands. Such a huge change should have caught its attention!</p>
			<p>A terrifying power emerged from the depths of the land, and it was evident that there were several experts fighting within.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and the others flew deeper into the white continent.</p>
			<p>As they went deeper and deeper, there was a weird holy energy that emerged from the lands.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong thought of the White Feather King when he felt the pulsating waves.</p>
			<p>“Don’t tell me that there’s really a treasure here…” A burning gaze appeared in the White Deer’s eyes.</p>
			<p>It could tell that the item was definitely not ordinary. The energy coming from the lands felt extremely familiar.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong also felt his heart speeding up.</p>
			<p>The number of treasures that could excite him could probably be counted on one hand. However, there were definitely a few of them that could tempt him into fighting for them.</p>
			<p>It was clear that the treasure that was about to appear was anything but ordinary.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sped up after thinking about it.</p>
			<p>The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng did the same.</p>
			<p>“This is mine! It appeared in my White Deer Cave, and I’m the owner of the region! You can’t fight me for it!” The White Deer snapped.</p>
			<p>“Nonsense. Didn’t the Universe Source Stone come from your territory too?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.</p>
			<p>The White Deer snorted in annoyance.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for the three of them to arrive.</p>
			<p>“It’s the experts from the Dazzling Black Race…” Yang Dingsheng gasped. “Their opponents are from the Ghost Ao Race!”</p>
			<p>The members of the Dazzling Black Race are the ones who had annoyed Huang Xiaolong previously. Even though Cao Cheng wasn’t part of the battle, his subordinates were.</p>
			<p>The Dazzling Black Race was considered one of the top races among the ancient races. The Ghost Ao Race was close to them in strength.</p>
			<p>Those who were fighting were experts who neared the 20 billion mark.</p>
			<p>The experts of the other races were enjoying their battle at the side, and Huang Xiaolong saw a giant lake slightly past them.</p>
			<p>Completely white in color, the lake emitted a milky glow that contained dense radiant energy.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could feel a strange power condensing deep in the lake, and the might it gave off was no weaker than the Universe Source Stone!</p>
			<p>From the looks of it, the object would only be ready after several hours…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls in order to spy on the object, only to be disappointed. There were countless restrictions around the lake made by the universes in order to protect the object within.</p>
			<p>It was the reason behind the massive battle that was taking place. Both parties wanted to lay claim to the item the moment it emerged.</p>
			<p>The Dazzling Black Race ignored Huang Xiaolong’s presence completely. After all, they couldn’t be bothered by the ‘weakling’ that traveled with Yang Dingsheng. As for the White Deer, it had long since concealed itself. It hid its aura and stood beside Huang Xiaolong like an ordinary creature.</p>
			<p>When the two parties were about to reach the climax of the battle, a massive flying ship tore through the air. It traveled towards them at a frightening speed and a giant shockwave arrived before the ship came.</p>
			<p>Seeing the insignia on the massive ship, everyone gasped in fright.𝘧𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p>“Golden Phoenix Race!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Race was ranked among the top five out of all the ancient races!</p>
			<p>The Dazzling Black Race and Ghost Ao Race might be strong, but they were far from comparable to the Golden Phoenix Race!</p>
			<p>The faces of Cao Cheng and the others changed and a look of fear crossed their faces.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for the flying ship to arrive. Several dozen people emerged from the ship and more than half of those who emerged were existences at the same level at Yang Dingsheng.</p>
			<p>Their leader was a young man who had a golden flame symbol dancing between his eyebrows.</p>
			<p>“Golden Phoenix Crown Prince!” many people yelled when they saw him.</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince was someone whose combat strength closed in on the 22 billion mark. He was only weaker than the Fortune Prince in the younger generation of the ancient races.</p>
			<p>As soon as he appeared, he swept his gaze across those present and sneered, “The item in the lake belongs to my Golden Phoenix Race. I’ll give all of you one minute to leave the area.” </p>
			<p>The faces of everyone present changed, but no one dared to speak out against him.</p>
			<p>Even so, no one took their leave.</p>
			<p>Ordinarily, they would listen to whatever the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince said. However, the treasure under the lake was too tempting.</p>
			<p>“Cripple anyone who doesn’t leave in a minute.” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince said to the experts behind him.</p>
			<p>When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, he walked towards the giant lake.</p>
			<p>However, a voice rang through the air as he approached. “Brat, the item under the lake is mine. If you approach the lake, I’ll cripple your legs!”</p>
			<p>Everyone turned to stare at the person who spoke with disbelief in their eyes. To their horror, the person who spoke was Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>Cao Cheng was stunned for a second, and he didn’t understand where Huang Xiaolong found his courage from. Did he not know the Golden Phoenix Race?</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince paused for a second before bursting into laughter. “Brat, you wish to cripple me?”</p>
			<p>He didn’t expect anyone to counter his threat with a threat of their own!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3727: Break His Legs</p>
			</title>
			<p>“You heard me,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince roared with laughter and pointed at Huang Xiaolong mockingly, “Did you hear that? This brat said that he plans to cripple me!”</p>
			<p>The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race burst out laughing.</p>
			<p>One of the experts of the Golden Phoenix Race approached the crown prince and said, “Your Highness, should we break his legs right now?”</p>
			<p>He looked at the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng behind Huang Xiaolong and continued, “Should we break their legs too?”</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince chuckled, “Alright, break them all. There’s no need to waste time with them.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Highness!” The expert laughed and started walking towards Huang Xiaolong and the others.</p>
			<p>The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race who approached them wasn’t weak. He was someone who closed in on the 20 billion mark, and his strength was stronger than the experts who were fighting earlier.</p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng might have known how strong Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer were, but he felt a sense of panic sweeping through his heart when he saw the expert from the Golden Phoenix Race approach. After all, the Golden Phoenix Race was known as one of the hegemons in the Fortune Space. An existence like the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince was more than enough to scare the old ancestors of the Yang Lightning Race into submission. </p>
			<p>A sneer formed on the crown prince’s face when he saw the expression on Yang Dingsheng’s face. He had long since recognized the man.</p>
			<p>When the expert from the Golden Phoenix Race arrived before Huang Xiaolong, the White Deer, and Yang Dingsheng, a golden light surrounded his fist and he punched towards the trio.</p>
			<p>He controlled his strength perfectly. Since the crown prince only wanted to break their legs, he would do just that. Moreover, he knew that the crown prince didn’t wish for them to die so soon. He wanted to torture them as he wished later.</p>
			<p>It was too bad his attack was stopped a hundred feet away from Huang Xiaolong and the others. The energy wave that was supposed to shatter their legs hovered in the air without dissipating.</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince gasped in shock and so did everyone else watching the farce.</p>
			<p>“Lord Cao Cheng, who would have thought that the youngster is an expert?!” the expert from the Dazzling Black Race who was fighting earlier exclaimed.</p>
			<p>All of them knew how strong Yang Dingsheng was. As such, they quickly associated the person who stopped the attack with Huang Xiaolong. From how easily he stopped it, his combat strength should have crossed the 20 billion mark.</p>
			<p>Even in the Fortune Space, he would be considered a supreme expert!</p>
			<p>After all, very few experts crossed the 20 billion units mark in the Fortune Space.</p>
			<p>Cao Cheng might be surprised by Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but a cold snort left his lips. “So what? After offending the Golden Phoenix Race, he’s dead anyway.”</p>
			<p>The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race felt his expression sinking and a cold snort left his lips. Golden light surrounded his body. It was clear that he planned to go all out.</p>
			<p>An endless amount of power poured out from his body as the golden light lit up the lands.</p>
			<p>At the same time, a giant hammer appeared in his hand as it smashed towards Huang Xiaolong. In an instant, the skies seemed to be covered by countless mountain-sized golden hammers.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms behind his back as he watched the hammers getting closer.</p>
			<p>Everyone couldn’t help but break out into discussion at the side.</p>
			<p>“This brat is crazy! Even if he crossed the 20 billion mark, he should defend himself! He’s obviously looking down on Huang Quan!”</p>
			<p>“When Huang Quan smashes him into a meat paste, I’ll call out in celebration!” </p>
			<p>Several experts in the crown sneered at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction.</p>
			<p>Seeing as the hammer was about to slam into his head, Huang Xiaolong casually raised a finger to stop it.</p>
			<p>With a light flick, the giant hammer was shattered into countless pieces. The expert from the Golden Phoenix Race, Huang Quan, was sent smashing through god knows how many mountain peaks before landing at the edge of the continent.</p>
			<p>The explosions that happened when he crashed through the mountains echoed through the skies.</p>
			<p>Cao Cheng and those standing around stared at him in shock.</p>
			<p>The faces of those from the Golden Phoenix Race changed.𝒇𝓻𝙚𝙚𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them as he turned to look at the crown prince’s legs. “Right now, you have already crossed the mark that I’ve set.”</p>
			<p>The crown prince of the Golden Phoenix Race never intended to listen to Huang Xiaolong. That was why he approached the lake when the exchange was going on.</p>
			<p>Everyone thought of Huang Xiaolong’s threat and someone in the crowd gasped, “Don’t tell me he’s really going to cripple the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince?!”</p>
			<p>That was an absurd notion! Everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong was messing around when he spoke earlier, but it seemed as though he was going to follow through with his threat!</p>
			<p>“Even if he plans to cripple the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince, he might not be strong enough to do so.” An ancient ancestor in the crown sneered, “The crown prince has more than 22 billion units of combat strength. That brat might be strong, but he isn’t a match for His Highness!”</p>
			<p>“That’s right! Lord Huang Ruocheng is here too. He’s someone who reached the 23 billion units mark!”</p>
			<p>Chaos broke out as everyone chattered among themselves.</p>
			<p>The crown prince snorted as a light of mockery flashed in his eyes. “So what if I did? Who do you think…”</p>
			<p>Before he could complete his sentence, a ray of light shot through the skies and he felt a sharp pain shooting through his legs. In the next instant, he was sent tumbling through the air.</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince landed on the ground and his face was covered in dust.</p>
			<p>Everyone saw that his legs had been completely shattered. </p>
			<p>“What?!”</p>
			<p>The experts of the various races yelled in fright.</p>
			<p>“Your Highness!” Huang Ruocheng of the Golden Phoenix Race gasped before running to the crown prince’s side.</p>
			<p>When he realized what had happened, the crown prince’s heart was filled with endless rage. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “Who the f*ck are you?!”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong.”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong?!” Everyone looked at each other in surprise. “Could he be the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor?”</p>
			<p>“No way… Isn’t he said to only possess 15 billion units of combat strength?”</p>
			<p>Suppressing the hatred in his heart, the crown prince growled, “You better not come to the Fortune Space in the future. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you suffer a fate ten thousand times worse than mine!”</p>
			<p>Unexpectedly, he ordered for the members of the Golden Phoenix Race to retreat after he laid down his threat!</p>
			<p>Before he left, he glared at Yang Dingsheng. “Humph, Yang Dingsheng from the Yang Lightning Race…”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3728: Item in the Lake</p>
			</title>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed and he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong like a pitiful kid who was wronged.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong casually sent a punch towards the flying ship.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>The punch shattered the ship completely! Whatever was left of the Golden Phoenix Flying Ship that was soaring through the skies ground to a complete halt. With a single punch, Huang Xiaolong shattered the eye of the formation powering the ship and some!</p>
			<p>The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race came tumbling out of the ship, including ancient ancestor, Huang Ruocheng.</p>
			<p>The faces of everyone present changed.</p>
			<p>Initially, Huang Xiaolong shattered the crown prince’s legs easily and that caused everyone’s evaluation of his strength to increase. Now, they became even more wary of Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>It seemed as though he wasn’t as weak as they thought!</p>
			<p>“If you dare to harm anyone related to Yang Dingsheng when you return, I’ll kill my way into your territory!” Huang Xiaolong growled. “Leave the ship. All of you can fly back on your own.” </p>
			<p>The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race glared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.</p>
			<p>“How dare you?!” one of the ancient ancestors roared. However, the crown prince stopped the man and endured the humiliation. “Alright. I will remember what you said here today.”</p>
			<p>“We’re leaving!”</p>
			<p>Leaving the ship behind, they flew towards the entrance of the White Deer Cave.</p>
			<p>In fact, Huang Xiaolong’s punch destroyed the formation on the ship completely. They couldn’t drive it away even if they wanted to.</p>
			<p>Those standing around looked at each other when they saw the members of the Golden Phoenix Race leaving with their tails tucked between their legs. Many people thought of leaving, but the temptation of obtaining the item in the lake was too much!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them. As long as they didn’t approach the lake, he was too lazy to deal with them.</p>
			<p>He could tell that Yang Dingsheng was still troubled by the threat of the Golden Phoenix Race, and he couldn’t help but sigh, “Brother Yang, there’s no need to worry. I’ll return to the Fortune Space with you in the future. The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince wouldn’t dare to harm anyone from the Yang Lightning Race.”</p>
			<p>Heaving a sigh of relief, Yang Dingsheng thanked, “Thank you, Brother Huang…”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong patted Yang Dingsheng’s shoulders several times before turning to look at the lake.</p>
			<p>The White Deer finally piped up, “Hey, you already got the Universe Source Stone. Leave this treasure for me!”</p>
			<p>The experts turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong has a piece of Universe Source Stone?!</p>
			<p>Knowing that the White Deer did it on purpose, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered by its little plans. “I was planning to give the item under the lake to you, but I changed my mind because of what you said.”</p>
			<p>“I’m definitely grabbing whatever appears.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s voice was firm.</p>
			<p>As an awkward expression appeared on its face, the White Deer sighed, “I… I didn’t mean to reveal your secret to everyone! I…”𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝑏𝓃𝑜𝑣𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p>
			<p>“Actually, I can give you whatever lies below this lake.” Huang Xiaolong grinned. “As long as you become my mount, you can have it!”</p>
			<p>“Bullsh*t!” A look of rage appeared on the White Deer’s face. “If you bring this up again, you can’t blame me for what I’ll do…”</p>
			<p>“What do you think you can do?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>The White Deer might be strong, but it was comparable to the White Feather King at best. Both of them knew what happened when Huang Xiaolong fought with the White Feather King.</p>
			<p>As the White Deer’s face turned completely red, it glared at Huang Xiaolong without saying another word.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was right. It couldn’t do anything!</p>
			<p>“Lord Cao Cheng, if the brat really has the Universe Source Stone, this is great news!” someone whispered to Cao Cheng.</p>
			<p>“In the future, he’s going to follow Yang Dingsheng to the Fortune Space. When that happens…”</p>
			<p>Cao Cheng felt his heart pumping in excitement.</p>
			<p>“I wonder what’s under the lake…” someone else asked. A look of greed flashed through his eyes. “If everyone gets into an all-out brawl, we might stand a chance! No matter how strong he is, he won’t be able to challenge all of us!”</p>
			<p>“All of you will play by ear. When an opportunity appears, grab the treasure!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Lord Cao Cheng!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s revelation of strength might have caused many of them to hesitate, but they were planning to fish in muddied waters. They would swarm Huang Xiaolong and win with sheer numbers.</p>
			<p>All of them thought the same way.</p>
			<p>Of course, Huang Xiaolong noticed everything. Too lazy to bother with them, he continued to look at the lake.</p>
			<p>Time ticked by and the white glow above the lake became more and more intense.</p>
			<p>The white light soon covered the entire continent.</p>
			<p>Under the illumination, the white continent became even more vibrant.</p>
			<p>An hour passed in the blink of an eye…</p>
			<p>A massive blast broke the silence and a massive wall of water burst out from the middle of the lake. A white flower slowly rose towards the skies.</p>
			<p>The white flower emitted brilliant rays of light that seemed to contain all the colors in the world. They were so interconnected that they looked completely white. When looking at it from afar, it looked like a snow-white arm!</p>
			<p>Everyone was shocked to discover the white flower with an odd appearance. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock. Every single petal seemed to contain a great world on its own. The power that was contained within reminded Huang Xiaolong of the Universe Source Stone.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong was still confused, a figure appeared above the lake. The figure was covered in pure darkness and no one could see his appearance. The only thing they could be sure of was his strength! He was definitely stronger than the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince and Huang Ruocheng!</p>
			<p>The moment he appeared, he reached for the white flower. However, a snow-white leg appeared and sent the expert flying.</p>
			<p>Yelling in fright, the expert was sent crashing into the edge of the continent. The wound on his chest where the leg landed extended all the way through his back, and his bones were visible to the world. The darkness around him disappeared and his appearance was revealed to the world.</p>
			<p>“Black Heart Old Ancestor!” Many people recognized him instantly.</p>
			<p>The Black Heart Old Ancestor was one of the strongest and most cruel experts in the Thirteen Universes. The number of people he killed couldn’t be counted, and there were rumors that his heart was pure black in color. That was how he got his title. His strength hovered around the 25 billion mark and even the old ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race would have to retreat in terror in the face of the Black Heart Old Ancestor.</p>
			<p>Now, he was sent flying by a single kick!</p>
			<p>When everyone turned to look at the individual who unleashed the terrifying kick, they were dumbstruck. It was the white deer that followed Huang Xiaolong around!</p>
			<p>Those who were hoping to grab the treasure for themselves felt their blood running cold.</p>
			<p>Before the White Deer could retrieve the White Flower, an arm reached out to stop it.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3729: Unescapable!</p>
			</title>
			<p>A feeling of rage filled its heart when it realized that someone was in its way. However, an awkward smile soon formed on the White Deer’s face when it saw that it was Huang Xiaolong’s arm.</p>
			<p>“That…”</p>
			<p>“I told you. I’m definitely going to grab that treasure,” Huang Xiaolong stated blandly.</p>
			<p>“Do you really think that I’m afraid of you?!” The White Deer yelled.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m sure as hell not afraid of you,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>Bouncing around with rage, the White Deer eventually chose to swallow its anger before negotiating with Huang Xiaolong for a part of the treasure.</p>
			<p>After several tens of minutes, the two of them reached an agreement. Half of the petals would belong to the White Deer and the others would go to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>In order to obtain half the petals, the White Deer chose to work for Huang Xiaolong for a hundred million years.</p>
			<p>Of course, it was only planning to work for Huang Xiaolong. Being a mount was out of the question. </p>
			<p>When the two of them were negotiating, the experts all around broke out into discussion. However, none of them chose to make a move. After all, the Black Heart Old Ancestor’s fate was there for all of them to see. All of them saw how serious the old expert’s injury was. Even if he could use universe-level spiritual veins to recover, he would take several hundreds of millions of years.</p>
			<p>It was extremely likely that he would never return to his peak level!</p>
			<p>Eventually, Huang Xiaolong split the treasure with the White Deer.</p>
			<p>Soon after, Huang Xiaolong brought along the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng as they left.</p>
			<p>The experts who were standing around only left reluctantly when Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>“Lord, should we investigate that little brat’s identity?” someone in the Dazzling Black Race asked.</p>
			<p>Cao Cheng nodded. “Find out if he’s really the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor!”</p>
			<p>“What if he is?” </p>
			<p>A light flashed through Cao Cheng’s eyes.</p>
			<p>After leaving the White Deer Cave, the three of them flew straight for the Fortune Space.</p>
			<p>At the same time, the members of the Golden Phoenix Race were doing the same. They were in a sorry state as they flew back all by themselves.</p>
			<p>When the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince thought of Huang Xiaolong, anger filled his heart. He turned to an expert beside him and growled, “Doesn’t Yang Dingsheng have a son?” </p>
			<p>“Your Highness, do you mean…” </p>
			<p>“Capture him right now!” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince snapped, “Cut off a piece of his flesh every day. I’ll torture him to the end of time when I return!” </p>
			<p>“As for Huang Xiaolong, go investigate his identity! If he really is the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor, get someone to kill everyone in there!” </p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince passed down several orders instantly.</p>
			<p>He never suffered such humiliation before.</p>
			<p>“What if Huang Xiaolong finds out? Wouldn’t he…” Huang Ruocheng asked.</p>
			<p>A snort left the crown prince’s lips. “So what if he does? When I return to the Fortune Space, he won’t be able to do anything to me! Does he dare to pick a fight with our Golden Phoenix Mountain? Humph! He’s asking for death if he dares to come!”  </p>
			<p>The old ancestor of the Golden Phoenix Race was the third strongest expert in the Fortune Space! He was an existence whose combat strength crossed the 29 billion mark!</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>After leaving the White Deer Cave, Huang Xiaolong was too annoyed by their slow flying speed, and he quickly brought out the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng stared at him in disbelief when they saw the ranked-number-one universe treasure.</p>
			<p>A complicated gaze formed on the White Deer’s face.</p>
			<p>Ignoring the animal, Huang Xiaolong entered the third layer of formations and brought out his portion of the White Flower. Plucking off a single petal, he tossed it into the eye of the formation.</p>
			<p>Sitting down, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art to devour the universe source qi.</p>
			<p>After several moments, Huang Xiaolong realized how much better the quality of universe source qi was! The qi produced from the petal of the White Flower allowed him to comprehend the mysteries of the universe at a faster rate compared to the past!</p>
			<p>The treasure really came at the right time!</p>
			<p>Excitement filled his heart. </p>
			<p>With the universe source qi produced from the petals of the White Flower, Huang Xiaolong felt that he could enter the half-step Universe God Realm in less than a hundred thousand years!𝙛𝓻𝙚𝙚𝔀𝙚𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p>Now, the Universe First Race was several hundred thousand years away from activating their Extermination Formation. He could definitely break through before they tried anything!</p>
			<p>When that happened, he wouldn’t even be afraid of the Black Nether King!</p>
			<p>The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng cultivated quietly on the ship. As they were unable to enter the grand formation, they couldn’t see Huang Xiaolong’s situation.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, Yang Dingsheng’s transmission symbol buzzed, and his expression turned ugly to the extreme after he read the contents.</p>
			<p>“What’s wrong?” The White Deer asked.</p>
			<p>“Lord White Deer…” Yang Dingsheng fell to his knees and bawled, “I received a report from one of my trusted friends from the race! He said that the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince ordered for my son’s arrest! He plans to cut off his flesh every single day and the old ancestor of my race doesn’t dare to say anything about it! Lord White Deer, please save my son!” </p>
			<p>The White Deer was stunned for a second, but a sneer soon formed on its lips. “That dumb*ss dares to ignore Lord Huang’s order… He’s definitely tired of living.” </p>
			<p>Helping Yang Dingsheng up, it continued, “You’re Lord Huang’s friend. Not to worry, I promise to get your son out!”  </p>
			<p>Yang Dingsheng thanked the White Deer profusely.</p>
			<p>Several months later…</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Fortune Space and he emerged from the third layer of formations. That was when he learned that the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince captured Yang Dingsheng’s son. His expression sank.</p>
			<p>“Do you know where your son is held?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
			<p>“He’s currently in the Lion King City in the Central Plains!” </p>
			<p>“That’s where we’re going then.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he steered the ship towards the Central Plains.</p>
			<p>A month later, they arrived.</p>
			<p>“I heard that the second piece of Universe Source Stone has appeared! It should be in the hands of someone called Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>“The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince ordered for Yang Dingsheng’s son’s arrest. Now, he’s held in Lion King City in order to draw Huang Xiaolong out. Nearly all the patriarchs have surrounded the city in wait for Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p>It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong overheard their secret voice transmissions.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3730: Can’t Thank You Enough</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong casually swiped at the air and dragged a group of experts over to himself.</p>
			<p>Not expecting anyone to grab them, they fell into a state of panic. When they were still dumbstruck, Huang Xiaolong searched through their memories.</p>
			<p>He learned quite a lot about Lion King City from them.</p>
			<p>All of them were ancient ancestors of their races, and they knew quite a bit.</p>
			<p>“More than thirty experts who broke through the 20 billion mark…” Huang Xiaolong scoffed. “Looks like the Universe Source Stone is really tempting…”</p>
			<p>The White Deer gasped in fright, “Are there actually so many of them?” </p>
			<p>More than thirty experts had crossed the 20 billion mark! That was practically all the experts the Fortune Space had to offer.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Other than Old Man Fortune and several others, almost all the experts in the Fortune Space have come. The old ancestor of the Golden Phoenix Race is also lying in wait in the city.</p>
			<p>“What?!” The White Deer’s expression turned serious. It might be strong, but the other party was also someone who crossed the 29 billion units mark. </p>
			<p>No matter who it was, they wouldn’t dare to look down on someone at that level.</p>
			<p>“Yeah. Other than Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian are there too.” </p>
			<p>The White Deer’s expression became a little more serious.</p>
			<p>The two of them were also existences who crossed the 29 billion mark.</p>
			<p>“Wouldn’t that mean that there are three experts who crossed the 29 billion mark in Lion King City?” The White Deer sucked in a cold breath and said.</p>
			<p>“That’s right. Are you afraid?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</p>
			<p>Puffing up its chest instantly, the White Deer sneered, “Nonsense! Why would I be afraid of Huang Ren and those old fogeys? There are only two people in the Thirteen Universe that can scare me. One of them is the Black Nether King and the other is Old Man Fortune! No one else is worthy of my attention!”</p>
			<p>“Looks like I’m just another weakling in your eyes…” Huang Xiaolong joked.</p>
			<p>An awkward smile appeared on the White Deer’s face. “I… That’s not what I meant!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer continued on their way towards the city in the midst of laughter.</p>
			<p>“Brother Huang, why don’t we forget about it…” Yang Dingsheng hesitated. “We can save him in the future!” </p>
			<p>He didn’t expect there to be so many supreme experts camping in the city! As an ancient ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race, he knew how strong they were! Any one of them could be considered a peak existence in the Fortune Space! Without Old Man Fortune, the three of them could do as they wished!”</p>
			<p>If they stomped their feet, the Fortune Space would tremble under their might!</p>
			<p>According to Yang Dingsheng, Huang Xiaolong, and the White Deer couldn’t go against the strongest powers of the Fortune Space even if they were terrifyingly strong!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “There’s no need to worry. Even if Old Man Fortune came, I’ll be able to save your son.”</p>
			<p>That was true. There was only a single person in existence who could cause Huang Xiaolong to hesitate. He was confident that he could defeat Old Man Fortune if push came to shove. Even though Old Man Fortune was slightly stronger than him, he had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Boat, and other universe treasures! He would smash Old Man Fortune to oblivion with his collection of treasures!</p>
			<p>One day later, the city came into view as the three of them stopped ten thousand miles away.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls only to discover those waiting in the city. </p>
			<p>Other than those who crossed the 20 billion mark, there were more than 200 experts slightly weaker than them!</p>
			<p>The weakest person among them had 15 billion units of combat strength!</p>
			<p>The White Deer managed to discover their presence as well and a frown formed on its face.</p>
			<p>“Let’s go. They already discovered us.” Huang Xiaolong entered the city after he spoke.</p>
			<p>As soon as they entered, several pillars of light rose into the sky and they intertwined to form a massive light barrier.</p>
			<p>They had laid down the trap a long time ago.</p>
			<p>“Hehe, Huang Xiaolong, you’re finally here,” a mocking laughter rang through the air. The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince and several others approached Huang Xiaolong’s group.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the prince, and he sneered, “Looks like you didn’t take my warning seriously.”</p>
			<p>Previously, he said that he would kill his way into the Golden Phoenix Race if anything happened to people related to Yang Dingsheng.</p>
			<p>Roaring with laughter, the crown prince sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? Why should I listen to you? Our old ancestor, Lord Zhou Fu, and Lord Shi Jian are currently waiting for you! You better follow me in obediently. Otherwise, we’ll capture you right here and now!” </p>
			<p>“Follow you in to greet your ancestors? They’re not qualified…” Huang Xiaolong snorted.</p>
			<p>The experts standing around gasped in shock.</p>
			<p>There were countless experts of the various races who came out along with the crown prince. The strongest among them reached the 27 billion units mark, and he was the continent master! His expression sank when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.</p>
			<p>“They’re not qualified? Do you really think that you’re Senior Fortune?!” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince sneered.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong casually pulled at the space before him and dragged the prince over to himself. Holding him by the neck, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Old Man Fortune?” </p>
			<p>The experts standing around finally reacted.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, release him immediately! Otherwise, you’re definitely going to die here today!” The continent master raged, “You won’t be able to escape from our grand formation today!” </p>
			<p>“Escape?” Huang Xiaolong smiled before popping the crown prince’s head like a balloon. </p>
			<p>With his intentional use of the Universe Origin Fires, there wasn’t the slightest bit of resistance.</p>
			<p>Miserable howls came from the crown prince as his head was blown into bits. His cries rang through the city.𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝓮𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝙢</p>
			<p>Everyone who came with him was dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you’re f*cked now!” The continent master roared and he lunged at Huang Xiaolong. “You won’t be able to pay for your sins even if you die ten thousand times over!”</p>
			<p>The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince’s identity in the Fortune Space was clear for all to see! He was comparable to the Fortune Prince, but Huang Xiaolong killed him like it was nothing! He basically waged war against the entire Golden Phoenix Race.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sent a casual slap flying towards the continent master.</p>
			<p>Bang!</p>
			<p>Smashing through countless structures, the continent master slammed into the restriction stopping Huang Xiaolong from escaping. It shook violently upon impact.</p>
			<p>Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they saw what happened.</p>
			<p>In an instant, countless figures appeared before Huang Xiaolong. The people in the lead were Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian!</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3731: Huang Ren Destroyed!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> As soon as Huang Ren appeared, he stared at the puddle of blood that was once the crown prince of his race as his expression fell. </p>
			<p> The crown prince’s soul had long since been tossed into the Universe Boat by Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, killing intent spewed out from his eyes. Huang Ren growled, “Originally, we would have allowed you to live after you handed over the Universe Source Stone, but now, you’ll die a horrible death! You will wish you hadn't been born!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Do you think you clowns are enough to back that claim up?” </p>
			<p> Anger filled the hearts of everyone present. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren and the others flew into a fit of rage. </p>
			<p> “Preposterous!” </p>
			<p> “Hand over the Universe Source Stone!” </p>
			<p> “Why are we wasting our breath with him? Kill him and search his soul! We’ll throw him into the eye of the Fortune Furnace and we’ll torture his soul for eternity!”  </p>
			<p> Several experts roared in anger. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sneered as his figure started to blur. When he reappeared, he punched out with 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> The skies changed color as a boundless energy swept towards the various experts present. </p>
			<p> When they felt the strength behind the punch, everyone felt their expressions changing. “Hurry up and flee!” </p>
			<p> Boom! </p>
			<p> Several ancient ancestors and patriarchs clashed with Huang Xiaolong’s phantom fist. </p>
			<p> Miserable howls filled the air. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren and the others wanted to make their move, but they were a tad bit too late. The experts who were struck were sent flying in an instant and their faces changed. </p>
			<p> Was that?! </p>
			<p> “Your combat strength reached the 29 billion units mark!” Zhou Fu gasped in surprise. </p>
			<p> Combat strength? </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p> That was pure grand cosmos energy. </p>
			<p> However, he didn’t wish to explain himself to this bunch of fools. Once again, a giant fist formed in the air as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art. </p>
			<p> This time, the punch was much stronger than before. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren yelled as golden flames surrounded his body. A burning knife appeared in his hand. </p>
			<p> The blade was massive, and it was three times bigger than any ordinary blade. It had the power to sunder the world! </p>
			<p> That was the inheritance treasure of the Golden Phoenix Race, a pseudo-universe treasure, the Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade! </p>
			<p> Even though it wasn’t a universe treasure, it was comparable to one! </p>
			<p> “Phoenix Blade Sunders the Earth!” </p>
			<p> Huang Ren circulated his energy to the limit as he greeted Huang Xiaolong’s fist. </p>
			<p> Buzz... </p>
			<p> A terrifying blade light came slashing down towards the fist. </p>
			<p> The blade light was god knows how many miles in length, and it was like a golden star river that came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> Clang! </p>
			<p> As the two attacks clashed, a massive explosion rang through the air. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s fist smashed through the blade completely. </p>
			<p> The Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade let out a terrifying screech as it was flung out of Huang Ren’s hand. Huang Xiaolong’s fist continued on towards Huang Ren’s chest. </p>
			<p> The golden armor around Huang Ren’s body was shattered immediately. He was sent tumbling through the air. </p>
			<p> “What?!” </p>
			<p> Zhou Fu and Shi Jian were stunned. They acted in unison as they rushed to block Huang Xiaolong’s strike. </p>
			<p> A thunderous roar could be heard as they slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s attack. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained firmly in place as the other two were forced to retreat several thousand miles. They crashed through countless structures in the city before coming to a stop. 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦𝑤𝘦𝑏𝓃ℴ𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> Silence fell upon the land. </p>
			<p> Every single expert who came to snatch Huang Xiaolong’s treasure felt their limbs going cold. </p>
			<p> Even the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng couldn’t believe what they were seeing. </p>
			<p> Shock filled the White Deer’s heart. Did Huang Xiaolong hold back against the White Feather King back in the White Deer Cave?! </p>
			<p> That was his true strength! </p>
			<p> From what the White Deer could tell, Huang Xiaolong was far stronger than Old Man Fortune! </p>
			<p> “You?!” Huang Ren tore through the skies and he glared at Huang Xiaolong in equal parts terror and rage. </p>
			<p> “I told you. You, clowns, aren’t capable of making me regret being born,” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly. </p>
			<p> Raising his arm, Huang Ren summoned the Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade that was flung far away. When it returned to his palm, he could see a giant mark smashed into its body. The strike from Huang Xiaolong basically deformed his blade. </p>
			<p> Even though golden light spewed out from the blade, it had lost its overbearing presence! It was no longer the magnificent pseudo-universe treasure it once was! In fact, it looked like some golden garbage someone picked up from the side of the street! </p>
			<p> Zhou Fu and Shi Jian appeared beside Huang Ren and their gaze revealed the shock in their hearts. </p>
			<p> No one dared to make a move. </p>
			<p> Initially, the plan was to bring Huang Xiaolong to the three supreme experts before forcing him to hand over the Universe Source Stone. When he handed it over, the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince would be able to do as he wished. </p>
			<p> Who would have thought that things would go in the completely opposite direction? </p>
			<p> No one knew what to do. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, no matter how strong you are, you’re going against all of us alone! I refuse to believe that you can stand against the experts of the Fortune Space all by yourself!” Huang Ren suppressed the shock in his heart and he roared.  </p>
			<p> “Brother Huang Ren is right!” Shi Jian continued, “Everyone, listen to my order! We’ll join hands and kill Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p> “We’ll split the Universe Source Stone equally!” </p>
			<p> “With the Universe Source Stone, everyone can break through!” </p>
			<p> “When that happens, we won’t be afraid of the Universe First Race any longer!” </p>
			<p> Naturally, he was full of sh*t. </p>
			<p> However, his voice rang through the city and the experts of the various races looked at each other hesitantly. </p>
			<p> “Heed my order! Kill Huang Xiaolong right now!” </p>
			<p> Under Huang Ren’s instructions, the various experts surrounded Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to take his life. </p>
			<p> A snort left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Blade of Death, and the Three Gods Halberd appeared. The Golden Sun Circlet appeared to protect his body as the Universe Origin Fires submerged the land in a sea of flames. </p>
			<p> Even though he only revealed five treasures, the horrifying pressure that came along with it made it hard for anyone present to breathe.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3732: Brute Force&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Those who were charging at him a second ago jumped in fright when they noticed the five universe treasures. </p>
			<p> Many of them stopped dead in their tracks. </p>
			<p> “Star... Star Dragon Divine Tree!” </p>
			<p> “Kill Huang Xiaolong and all his treasures will belong to us!” Zhou Fu yelled in excitement, “Kill! Kill him right now!” </p>
			<p> Leaping towards Huang Xiaolong, a giant axe appeared in his hand. The axe seemed to be born from darkness as it was jet black in color. As the axe slashed towards Huang Xiaolong, a weird absorption strength emerged. </p>
			<p> Shi Jian used a long spear that glowed an earthly yellow. It shot towards Huang Xiaolong as the earth below trembled. A shocking amount of power emerged from beneath the ground and went straight for Huang Xiaolong’s legs. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren used the deformed Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade to chop at Huang Xiaolong once again. </p>
			<p> As for the other experts, they attacked in unison. </p>
			<p> What would happen when over two hundred experts at their level struck at once?  </p>
			<p> The heavens shattered as the city was blasted to smithereens. </p>
			<p> Every single structure in the city crumbled in an instant as the space around them showed signs of cracking. </p>
			<p> It was utter annihilation. </p>
			<p> Yang Dingsheng gasped in horror as Huang Xiaolong circulated the Universe Transformation Art. </p>
			<p> 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body instantly. Huang Xiaolong no longer held back. </p>
			<p> As he revealed his full strength, a blinding ray of light emerged from the various universe treasures he revealed. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Divine Tree spewed out star dragon qi endlessly as the Universe Origin Fires turned into a blazing inferno that swept towards the members of the Fortune Space. The Golden Sun Circlets turned into a shining golden dragon as the Blade of Death emitted waves of death qi. The Three Gods Halberd drew over the power of water from all over the lands. 𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝘯𝘰𝘷ℯ𝘭.𝑐𝘰𝑚</p>
			<p> Die! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t retreat in the slightest when faced with so many experts. The weapons in his hands swung towards the nearest few. </p>
			<p> Rip! </p>
			<p> The artifacts in the hands of those from the Fortune Space were torn to shreds by the Blade of Death and the Three Gods Halberd. When they were struck by the energy wave that followed, many of them were sent flying as they spat out mouthfuls of blood. </p>
			<p> In the instant Huang Xiaolong made his move, the White Deer did the same. It rushed into the group of experts as a milky white flame covered its body. Two rays of light emerged from its horns. </p>
			<p> The light that emerged seemed to contain the purest form of radiance energy in the Thirteen Universes! </p>
			<p> Everyone felt as though their dao souls were trembling when the light emerged. </p>
			<p> The faces of Huang Ren and the others changed. “Beware! That’s the Light of Life!” </p>
			<p> Light of Life! </p>
			<p> There was only a single existence who possessed a bloodline strong enough to wield the Light of Life! </p>
			<p> As the source of all life, the Light of Life not only had the power to give life... It could also take away whatever vitality one had! </p>
			<p> Despite their warning, it came a little too late. One of the ancient ancestors was struck by the Light of Life. </p>
			<p> In an instant, his divine armor and the grand cosmos energy he used to protect himself shattered. </p>
			<p> The Light of Life didn’t stop there. It continued towards someone else! It pierced through another expert before carrying on to the third. </p>
			<p> Finally reacting, the third expert sent out a punch to stop the Light of Life but he was far too weak compared to the White Deer. The Light of Life pierced through his arm and went straight into his chest. </p>
			<p> Zhou Fu yelled in shock, “F*ck! Don’t bother fighting it! Dodge it! Unless you have a universe treasure, you won’t be able to block the Light of Life!” </p>
			<p> It was too bad the Light of Life reached the fourth expert. </p>
			<p> When the fifth in line managed to dodge the Light of Life, he heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> Slamming straight into the only structure left standing in Lion King City, the city walls, the Light of Life tore a massive hole through it. </p>
			<p> “You... You’re the Master of the White Deer Cave!” someone gasped in terror. </p>
			<p> Previously, everyone had their eyes on Huang Xiaolong. No one would pay attention to an unassuming white deer that was beside him! Now, everyone felt their minds buzzing in shock when they thought of its identity. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian were equally as shocked. </p>
			<p> Even though they had never seen the White Deer, they knew how scary it was. </p>
			<p> If they fought it one-on-one, none of them would be its match! </p>
			<p> Another change happened on the battlefield as blood qi filled the skies. Six oddly shaped creatures appeared beside Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Are those the five monster kings from the Netherworld in the Unknown Space?!” someone screamed. </p>
			<p> They were right. Those were indeed the monster kings from the Netherworld. However, there was something they were mistaken about. There were six of them! Not many people knew about the existence of the Ghost Devil King, but he was the strongest among the six! </p>
			<p> “No! They are the six monster kings!” Zhou Fu yelled in fright. </p>
			<p> No one expected Huang Xiaolong to subdue them all. </p>
			<p> “That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “It’s my turn now. Kill them all!” </p>
			<p> The Blade of Death and Three Gods Halberd disappeared all of a sudden. In their place appeared a golden boat. </p>
			<p> The golden light around the boat contained the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes, and a mysterious qi surrounded all of them. </p>
			<p> “Could it be?!” A horrifying thought flashed through Huang Ren’s mind, and his expression changed. </p>
			<p> The golden boat in his hand expanded by tens of thousands of times and it covered the skies above Lion King City.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong waved his hand once and sent the Universe Boat smashing into the crowd. </p>
			<p> Not many people reacted in time and many of them were struck. When they were, they were sent flying. </p>
			<p> The golden light around the Universe Boat wasn’t for show. It contained extreme power and it shot towards Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian! </p>
			<p> “That’s the Universe Boat! Hurry up and run!” Zhou Fu gasped. </p>
			<p> It was too bad that the Universe Boat was too damn fast! No one could escape! </p>
			<p> Seeing as there was no way out, Shi Jian screamed in a last-ditch attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong. “Die!” </p>
			<p> He circulated all the energy he had in order to block the incoming boat. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren and Zhou Fu did the same. When they unleashed everything they had at once, not even Old Man Fortune would dare to take the strike head-on. However, Huang Xiaolong was no Old Man Fortune and the Universe Boat was no ordinary treasure. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong commanded the boat to crash straight into them! </p>
			<p> The instant their attacks landed on the body of the Universe Boat, they were sent flying.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3733: Half-Step Universe God!&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Once they were out of the picture, the Universe Boat’s next target became those ancient ancestors and patriarchs of the various races. </p>
			<p> The speed of the Universe Boat was terrifying, to begin with. With Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy to supplement it, it didn’t take long for the Universe Boat to arrive before the others. </p>
			<p> Miserable shrieks filled the skies. </p>
			<p> Countless experts were sent flying in an instant. </p>
			<p> If Huang Ren and the others couldn’t escape their fate of being beaten badly, there was nothing more to say about those experts. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat was basically an unstoppable existence. Coupled with Huang Xiaolong’s unparalleled strength, it could wipe away anyone in its path! Not to mention the fact that he was using it to intentionally crash into the experts present. </p>
			<p> In two breaths of time, nearly half of the experts were dealt with. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong sent the Universe Boat straight into the light barrier that was supposed to keep him in the city. </p>
			<p> Bang!  </p>
			<p> It was as though he tore a hole through the heavens as a giant gap was formed in the light barrier around the city. </p>
			<p> Darkness could be seen in the space outside the barrier. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren and the others felt the world crumbling around them when they saw how powerful Huang Xiaolong really was. Their hearts went cold and their legs went numb. </p>
			<p> They used almost every single resource in their treasury to create the formation around the city. They thought that it was extremely sturdy and no one would be able to break out of it. Now, it failed to take a single strike from the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> When the Universe Boat was done with the formation, Huang Xiaolong turned it around and sent it towards the Huang Ren trio again. </p>
			<p> Their expressions changed and they no longer dared to take the strike head-on. They fled in three different directions. </p>
			<p> As soon as they disappeared from their spot, the ship smashed deep into the ground. </p>
			<p> The entire continent was blown apart as a bottomless abyss formed. </p>
			<p> Experts at the level of Huang Ren might have broken through the 29 billion mark, but they were terrified when they saw what happened. </p>
			<p> It was lucky the three of them dodged, otherwise, they would have turned into meat paste. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat was the strongest universe treasure! It was ranked number one in terms of offensive abilities, defensive abilities, and speed! </p>
			<p> No matter how strong their bodies were, they wouldn’t be able to resist the Universe Boat! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong recalled the Universe Boat and stared at the three of them coldly. When he was about to send the Universe Boat into them once again, Zhou Fu yelled, “Brother Huang, wait a minute! We have something to tell you!” </p>
			<p> “?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the three of them with a raised eyebrow. </p>
			<p> “Brother Huang, we were too rash! We offended you by accident as we only wanted the Universe Source Stone to go against the Universe First Race!” Shi Jian continued, “Brother Huang, please forgive us!” </p>
			<p> “That’s right! We heard that they wanted to destroy the Thirteen Universes again. All of us wish to stop them, and our common enemy is the Universe First Race!” Huang Ren explained, “If we fight among ourselves now, they will be extremely happy to see us kill each other off!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Are you sure you wish to obtain the Universe Source Stone in order to stand against the Universe First Race?” </p>
			<p> “Yes... Of course!” Zhou Fu panicked. “However, Brother Huang is a supreme being! The Universe Source Stone will be much more useful in your hands!” </p>
			<p> “From what you’re saying, you guys don’t want the Universe Source Stone any longer, is that right?” Huang Xiaolong asked.  </p>
			<p> “We don’t want it anymore!” The three of them replied in unison. </p>
			<p> “Aren’t you planning to take revenge for your grandson?” Huang Xiaolong asked Huang Ren. </p>
			<p> A stern look appeared on Huang Ren’s face, and he snapped, “He went too far by offending Brother Huang! I can’t blame you for his death!” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained silent as he looked at the three shameless b*stards standing before him. </p>
			<p> All three of them clenched their fists tightly as they looked at Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Whatever the case, I haven’t been able to move my muscles. Since you’re able to put up a fight, let’s exchange pointers!” </p>
			<p> Their expressions changed instantly. </p>
			<p> The Universe Boat expanded once again. </p>
			<p> ... </p>
			<p> Half a day later... </p>
			<p> The entire continent was turned into rubble from the battle. </p>
			<p> Huang Ren and the others were beaten so badly that even their mothers wouldn’t recognize them. </p>
			<p> After torturing them for a little while longer, Huang Xiaolong finally let them off. </p>
			<p> It was easy for Huang Xiaolong to defeat the three of them, but it wouldn’t be possible for him to make them submit to him. </p>
			<p> Turning around, Huang Xiaolong left. </p>
			<p> Yang Dingsheng brought his son along as he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely. </p>
			<p> Allowing them to get up, he made them lead the way to the headquarters of the Yang Lightning Race. When Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer arrived, they received a shocking welcome from the race. </p>
			<p> Even though the old ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race didn’t take part in the battle, he had long since heard the outcome. </p>
			<p> When they arrived, the White Deer didn’t waste any time, and it saved Yang Dingsheng’s wife immediately. In a single day, Yang Dingsheng’s wife recovered completely.  </p>
			<p> Staying in the Yang Lightning Race, Huang Xiaolong entered the Universe Boat to continue his cultivation. At the same time, he learned that Old Man Fortune wasn’t in the Fortune Space. </p>
			<p> “Where can he be?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. It was no wonder the old man didn’t appear during the battle. </p>
			<p> “I heard that he left the Fortune Space several tens of thousands of years ago.” </p>
			<p> “Go look into his whereabouts,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. </p>
			<p> “Alright!” The White Deer nodded before leaving. </p>
			<p> Soon after, Huang Xiaolong got the White Deer to pay attention to Huang Ren, Shi Jian, and Zhou Fu before entering seclusion. </p>
			<p> Now, he had to break into the half-step Universe God Realm as quickly as possible! </p>
			<p> He completely refined the White Flower after several dozen thousand years, and he tossed the Universe Source Stone into the eye of the formation before comprehending the images in the Nameless Devil Mirror. </p>
			<p> After nearly a hundred thousand years, pillars of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. It contained an endless amount of power as Huang Xiaolong experienced a complete transformation. 𝓯𝙧𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝓿𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3734: Location of the Black Nether King&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> Even though he broke through, Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to emerge from seclusion. He continued to comprehend the secrets behind the mirror as he devoured whatever universe source qi was in the formation. </p>
			<p> It didn’t take long before the day arrived. It was the day the Universe First Race would activate the Extermination Formation! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that there wasn’t any movement from the Universe First Race! </p>
			<p> As soon as he emerged from the Universe Boat, he summoned the White Deer. </p>
			<p> “Did Huang Ren and the others do anything out of the ordinary lately?” </p>
			<p> “Nope.” The White Deer shook its head. “Old Man Fortune hasn’t come back either. I asked many experts in the Fortune Space, and all of them said that Old Man Fortune went out to look for a fortuitous encounter to break through to the Universe God Realm. He went to a faraway land, but no one knows where that is.” </p>
			<p> “Faraway land?” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “What about the Universe First Race?” </p>
			<p> “They have remained quiet in recent years.” The White Deer shook its head. “We can only be sure that the Black Nether King isn’t currently in the Universe Vault!” </p>
			<p> Light sparkled in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.  </p>
			<p> It definitely wasn’t a coincidence that Old Man Fortune and the Black Nether King went missing at the same time. </p>
			<p> According to the conversation between Heaven Tyrant and the Star Refinement King, the Extermination Formation should have been activated! However, nothing happened so far, and the Black Nether King was nowhere to be found! There had to be something going on! </p>
			<p> Moreover, the Universe First Race was being too low profile and Huang Xiaolong felt that something was off. </p>
			<p> Retrieving his transmission symbol, Huang Xiaolong contacted the Blood Phoenix Queen and Titan King. He soon received a reply. The Black Nether King hasn’t started the Extermination Formation and no one knows where he went. </p>
			<p> However, they said that Heaven Tyrant might have a clue as to where the Black Nether King went. </p>
			<p> “Heaven Tyrant...” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝑚</p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong asked them about the Heaven Tyrant’s whereabouts. </p>
			<p> After learning that Heaven Tyrant was staying around the Star Refinement King recently, Huang Xiaolong decided to return to the Universe Vault. </p>
			<p> “Entering the Universe Vault?!” The White Deer gasped. </p>
			<p> “That’s right. We’re leaving in a bit.” </p>
			<p> Now, Huang Xiaolong wanted nothing more than to know the Black Nether King’s whereabouts. </p>
			<p> Since he entered the half-step Universe God Realm, he was no longer afraid of the Black Nether King. He wanted to figure out what the Black Nether King planned to do exactly. After all, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Black Nether King had always been acting a little weirdly. </p>
			<p> “We’re leaving in a bit?!” The White Deer yelled. It had no idea what the rush was. </p>
			<p> “Yes.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He didn’t explain too much to the White Deer and quickly looked for Yang Dingsheng. Handing over countless pills and top-grade universe-level spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong bade his farewell and left for the Universe Vault. </p>
			<p> Along the way, Huang Xiaolong brought out the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p> Even so, it took him an entire year to arrive. When he entered the Universe Vault, he didn’t waste a second as he went straight for the Star Refinement King’s palace. </p>
			<p> After several months, Huang Xiaolong arrived. </p>
			<p> He used his dao souls to scout his surroundings and discovered that Heaven Tyrant was really hiding in the Star Refinement King’s palace. </p>
			<p> The Star Refinement King, Golden Cymbals King, Heaven Devouring King, and the Golden Qilin King were all present! </p>
			<p> Other than the White Feather King, every expert in the Universe Vault who crossed the 27 billion mark had arrived! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of excitement filling his heart. </p>
			<p> Since they were all present, he would take care of all of them at once! </p>
			<p> If he hadn’t broken through, he couldn’t be sure that he had the ability to suppress all of them at once. Now, he was absolutely certain that he could take them all down. </p>
			<p> With a wave of his arm, the Star Dragon Divine Tree filled the skies and locked down the entire area. </p>
			<p> When he was done, Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat away. He emerged with the White Deer. </p>
			<p> “Who?!” The moment they revealed themselves, the Star Refinement King and the others were alerted. </p>
			<p> Charging out of the palace instantly, they were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?!” The Golden Cymbals King and Heaven Devouring King yelled in unison. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong?!” The Star Refinement King scoffed, “Are you really Huang Xiaolong?!” </p>
			<p> However, his expression changed slightly when he saw the White Deer. “Are you the master of the White Deer Cave?!” </p>
			<p> He had sealed off the White Deer Cave in the past along with the White Feather King, and he was extremely familiar with the White Deer. </p>
			<p> Everyone else looked at the White Deer in fright. </p>
			<p> “Star Refinement King, are you surprised to see me?” The White Deer sneered. It looked at the palace behind them and chuckled, “That’s a nice palace. Looks like you really know how to enjoy life...” </p>
			<p> The Golden Cymbals King shattered a transmission symbol but it was stopped by a wave of starlight. The faces of the various kings changed. </p>
			<p> “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you intrude into our Universe Vault? You’re asking to die!” The Star Refinement King snorted, “Do you really think that you can stop the five of us with just your Star Dragon Divine Tree?”  </p>
			<p> “I can try.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. </p>
			<p> A fan that emitted faint starlight appeared in the Star Refinement King’s hand, and he swung it towards Huang Xiaolong. A torrent of energy surged towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> The Star Fan was one of the thirteen universe treasures. </p>
			<p> Remaining completely calm, Huang Xiaolong reached out a single arm to stop the energy wave. </p>
			<p> The faces of everyone changed. </p>
			<p> The White Feather King revealed Huang Xiaolong’s strength after returning from the White Deer Cave. Many of them were doubtful of his claims, but now, it seemed as though everything he said was true! </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King, Golden Qilin King, and Golden Cymbals King flew into the skies in unison. There were countless black swords flying towards Huang Xiaolong and the Golden Qilin King revealed his true form. Turning into a giant qilin, a golden beam shot towards Huang Xiaolong from its mouth. </p>
			<p> As for the Golden Cymbals King, he tossed out his golden cloth once again as a golden rain fell upon the lands. </p>
			<p> All of them went all out instantly. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive as he sent a slap flying towards the three of them.</p>

				<p> &lt;h4&gt;Chapter 3735: Universe Source&lt;/h4&gt; </p>
			</title>
			<p> A single slap from Huang Xiaolong sent all three of them flying. </p>
			<p> When they slammed into the Star Refinement King’s palace below, it exploded into countless fragments. </p>
			<p> When Huang Xiaolong met the Heaven Devouring King and Golden Cymbals King back in the Unknown Space, he was unable to stand against the Heaven Devouring King no matter how hard he tried. Now, he was able to trash them without using one-tenth of his strength. </p>
			<p> The Star Refinement King who wanted to go in for the kill stared at the three of them in shock. His heart thumped in his chest as he swung his Star Fan once again. Countless stars fell from the void and it slammed into the Star Dragon Grand Formation. </p>
			<p> With the endless amount of stars smashing into the formation, the light barrier became much dimmer than before. </p>
			<p> After all, the Star Refinement King was an expert who crossed the 29 billion mark. With a universe treasure to supplement his strength, he was no walkover. </p>
			<p> Right before he could unleash another strike, boundless star dragon qi emerged from the void. The barrier that looked a little weaker than before recovered to its peak state. </p>
			<p> The Star Refinement King’s expression changed. </p>
			<p> He gave it his all during the strike previously, but the Star Dragon Grand Formation restored itself before he could continue! It was obvious that he wasn’t going to shatter the formation.  </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong appeared before him with a single step. As the Star Refinement King was still stuck in a state of shock, he swung his Star Fan without a second thought. Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother dodging and his punch landed squarely on the Star Refinement King’s chest. </p>
			<p> In front of everyone, Huang Xiaolong popped the Star Refinement King’s heart. </p>
			<p> The Heaven Devouring King and the others gasped in fright. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the Star Refinement King any longer as he turned to look at Heaven Tyrant. </p>
			<p> Fear could be seen deep in his eyes and just as he was about to turn to flee, Huang Xiaolong dragged him over. Too lazy to ask his question, Huang Xiaolong directly conducted a soul search. </p>
			<p> Moments later, Huang Xiaolong learned where the Black Nether King was. However, he was shocked by his discovery. According to Heaven Tyrant’s memory, Old Man Fortune left in search of the Universe Origin. When the Black Nether King heard of it, he used all the connections he had to uncover the location of the Universe Origin before heading there too. </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank. </p>
			<p> It was no wonder Old Man Fortune didn’t show up during the battle. </p>
			<p> Similarly, the Black Nether King didn’t activate the Extermination Formation on time. </p>
			<p> As it turned out, the two of them went in search of the Universe Origin! </p>
			<p> The Universe Origin was said to be the birthplace of the Thirteen Universes. </p>
			<p> According to the legends, that was where all the universe treasures came from, along with all thirteen universes. </p>
			<p> The Universe Origin was akin to the mother of all things! </p>
			<p> According to even more rumors, there were special energies that existed in the Universe Origin. There were high-level grand dao laws and a special method to break through to the Universe God Realm. </p>
			<p> Naturally, that was just a rumor. No one had been able to enter the Universe Origin. </p>
			<p> “Universe Origin...” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled. </p>
			<p> Without the Universe Source Stone, the Black Nether King would find it impossible to break through. However, he might actually find a way to do it after locating the Universe Origin! </p>
			<p> He might even be able to locate a fortuitous encounter and enter the Universe God Realm immediately! </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong was sure that the Black Nether King wouldn’t be able to break through no matter what he tried, but now that the Universe Origin was located, he wasn’t so sure anymore. </p>
			<p> Moreover, there was the Old Man Fortune. His chances of entering the Universe God Realm might be even smaller than the Black Nether King, but nothing was set in stone! </p>
			<p> No matter who broke through, it would spell doom for Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p> As such, he had to locate the Universe Origin before any of them! </p>
			<p> However, Heaven Tyrant might know that his master went to look for the Universe Origin, but he had no idea where it actually was! </p>
			<p> The only question in Huang Xiaolong’s mind now was to locate the Universe Origin! </p>
			<p> He thought about the Submerged Dragon Institution in the Star Dragon World. </p>
			<p> Since the Star Dragon Universe was one of the most ancient existences it might know where the Universe Origin was! </p>
			<p> If the Star Dragon Universe didn’t know, Huang Xiaolong could only use all the resources available to him to look for it. </p>
			<p> Two years later, Huang Xiaolong arrived back in the Submerged Dragon Institution. </p>
			<p> When the Star Dragon Universe met Huang Xiaolong again, it was overjoyed! However, the Star Dragon Universe was stunned to discover his intentions. </p>
			<p> “You wish to go to the Universe Origin?” </p>
			<p> “Senior Star Dragon Universe, do you know where it is?” Huang Xiaolong asked anxiously. </p>
			<p> “I do, but...” </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong rejoiced in his heart. Indeed, the Star Dragon Universe knew where the Universe Origin was! </p>
			<p> “There’s no need to get excited. It is extremely difficult to get there.” The Star Dragon Universe explained, “The Universe Origin exists outside the Thirteen Universes. There are countless layers of barriers standing between the two. For one to arrive at the Universe Origin, one will have to cross countless world barriers. They aren’t exactly easy to overcome...” </p>
			<p> “World barriers?” Huang Xiaolong gasped. </p>
			<p> He didn’t expect the Universe Origin to be located outside the Thirteen Universes. </p>
			<p> “Yes. In order to arrive, you will need to break through three thousand natural world barriers.” The Star Dragon Universe continued, “The closer you get, the stronger the barrier. Without 29 billion units of combat strength, you won’t be able to enter.”  </p>
			<p> 29 billion units? </p>
			<p> Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
			<p> “Does that mean that anyone with more than 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy can arrive at the Universe Origin?” </p>
			<p> “Yes.” </p>
			<p> Circulating all three great worlds in his body at once, boundless energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. </p>
			<p> The Star Dragon Universe stared at him in shock. </p>
			<p> “You... You have already broken...” </p>
			<p> It didn’t expect that in the millions of years that Huang Xiaolong was gone, he would reach the half-step Universe God Realm! It knew that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds, and as such, his grand cosmos energy definitely reached the 30 billion mark! </p>
			<p> “Senior Star Dragon Universe, I should be able to arrive at the Universe Origin with my strength, right?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. 𝒻𝓇𝘦𝘦𝘸𝘦𝘣𝘯𝑜𝓋𝘦𝑙.𝒸𝑜𝓂</p>

				<p>Chapter 3736: Locating the Universe Origin</p>
			</title>
			<p>Soon after, a ray of light fell from the void and entered the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. A memory of the Universe Origin that never existed before in Huang Xiaolong’s mind appeared.𝙛𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝓮𝒃𝓷𝓸𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>It told him everything he needed to know about the dangers of getting there.</p>
			<p>“Many thanks to Senior Star Dragon Universe.” Huang Xiaolong was extremely grateful to the Star Dragon Universe. The piece of information was too important to him. Without it, no one knew how long it would take for him to locate the Universe Origin! Now, he even knew about the dangers that would come with his journey. It made things much easier and it would shorten the time he needed to travel there!</p>
			<p>Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the institution and boarded the Universe Boat. He charged straight for the Universe Origin.</p>
			<p>Leaving behind a terrifying tear through space, the Universe Boat soared through the air at a terrifying pace. Huang Xiaolong didn’t care if anyone were to discover his presence.</p>
			<p>Several years later, he finally arrived at the space outside the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>When he arrived, he discovered that there was nothing as far as his eyes could see. He used his dao souls in order to investigate what lay in the void, but there wasn’t a single sign of life.</p>
			<p>After getting his bearings right, Huang Xiaolong continued northwards according to the memory left behind by the Star Dragon Universe.</p>
			<p>Half a day later, he arrived at the first layer of natural world barriers. </p>
			<p>The barrier was like an endless wall that extended to infinity. It was several hundred meters thick!</p>
			<p>Even though it wasn’t as thick as he thought, it was incredibly sturdy! Any attacks that landed on it would be bounced back with increased power. It was nearly impossible for anyone to break a natural world barrier.</p>
			<p>However, what might be impossible for most was definitely possible for Huang Xiaolong. With a single punch, he created a massive hole in the barrier.</p>
			<p>Soaring forward, he quickly entered the gap he made.</p>
			<p>The barrier might stop most half-step Universe Gods, but Huang Xiaolong stood firmly at the peak of the power spectrum in the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>Soon after, he ran into the second barrier.</p>
			<p>Like before, he did the same thing.</p>
			<p>After a whole month, Huang Xiaolong crossed one hundred barriers in total. After the first hundred barriers, it became a lot harder to break them. There were universe storms and black holes that would appear from time to time.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s speed started to slow down quite a bit. He used a little more than a month to break the next hundred barriers.</p>
			<p>Soon came the third and fourth set of barriers.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong discovered that for every hundred barriers he broke, the difficulty would increase by a lot. There would be much more dangerous regions that appeared too. For example, there were sharp ice blades and backwinds that appeared.</p>
			<p>Saturated Water appeared in the space around him after he crossed the one-thousandth barrier.</p>
			<p>When he broke through two thousand barriers, golden rain started to appear!</p>
			<p>The golden rain had terrifying corrosive abilities. It was the same as the one used by the Golden Cymbals King. The golden rain around the world barriers was much more terrifying than the ones used by the Golden Cymbals King!</p>
			<p>Several dozen years later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the third set of thousand barriers.</p>
			<p>He heaved a long sigh when he arrived.</p>
			<p>The first world barrier at the three-thousandth barrier mark was several tens of thousands of meters thick!</p>
			<p>Moreover, there were countless runes inscribed on the world barrier. They were like golden earthworms that squirmed around on the barrier and they possessed terrifying strength. Formless pressure filled the space around Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A serious look appeared on his face.</p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong could definitely break a hole through the barrier with his current strength, he summoned the Universe Boat to be safe.</p>
			<p>As the strongest universe treasure, Huang Xiaolong was more than confident in its defensive capabilities. </p>
			<p>Entering the third layer of formations on the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy as rays of resplendent light emerged from the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>Turning into a streak of golden light, he tore through the barrier. </p>
			<p>The moment he entered the space after the three-thousandth barrier, Huang Xiaolong felt a little suffocated. </p>
			<p>The pressure that came from the Universe Source itself tried to enter the Universe Boat, but Huang Xiaolong quickly poured a little more power into the Universe Boat to repel the weird pressure.</p>
			<p>He traveled slowly towards the next barrier. Now, his speed was comparable to a mortal walking on the streets.</p>
			<p>He would take several hours to finally cross the barrier.</p>
			<p>After half a day, he crossed the world barrier and entered a world that was covered in light.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was thrown into an illusion when he looked at the world around him.</p>
			<p>Reaching out to touch the light that was all over the place, he was stunned to discover that he couldn’t control the power of light in the area.</p>
			<p>Using the power of space, Huang Xiaolong locked down the entire area around the Universe Boat. However, the ball of light wasn’t affected by his power.</p>
			<p>He chose to continue onwards warily.</p>
			<p>After a day, nothing around him changed. </p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>Even after a year of traveling, the light around him didn't seem to dissipate. Other than the odd light, there was nothing else. </p>
			<p>After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong felt that Star Dragon Universe might have made a mistake in the location!</p>
			<p>Even so, he continued to travel onwards.</p>
			<p>Another year of nothingness passed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was the only one left in the universe.</p>
			<p>Countess years passed just like that.</p>
			<p>However, he felt a wave of fluctuations coming from the Universe Origin itself, and Huang Xiaolong quickly steered the ship towards the direction of the energy waves.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long for him to discover balls of energy hovering in the skies. Even though it was extremely pure, it was still lacking a little compared to the Universe Source Stone he obtained in the past.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of excitement buzzing in his heart. The Universe Origin should be close!</p>
			<p>After all, the Universe Origin was the only place that could produce such power.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong increased his speed once again.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3737: Origin Universe</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong drove the ship between the balls of energy but countless days later, there was no change in his surroundings.</p>
			<p>The energy balls formed dense clouds in the space and Huang Xiaolong traveled onwards carefully.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was the only person traveling through the vast space as several years passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>If not for there being more clouds of energy, Huang Xiaolong would have long since turned around.</p>
			<p>After dozens of years, he saw the end.</p>
			<p>Blinding rays of light came from the region outside the energy sea, and Huang Xiaolong steered his ship carefully into the distance.</p>
			<p>He was shocked to discover that the light was so dense that it formed a giant curtain that hovered in the space before him.</p>
			<p>The light curtain was endless, and it seemed to separate the space between them completely.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had no idea how large the curtain of light was, but he had a strong suspicion that he would be able to arrive at the Universe Origin after crossing the curtain of light! </p>
			<p>Calming himself down, Huang Xiaolong charged straight through the curtain of light.</p>
			<p>The moment he entered, a massive blast could be heard. The light curtain seemed to drape over the Universe Boat as the entire structure trembled.</p>
			<p>Rays of light covered the ship as Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat was extremely sturdy. Even if experts whose combat strength crossed the 20 billion mark gave it their all, they wouldn’t be able to shake the ship in the slightest. Now, the Universe Boat was rocking like a tiny boat in the ocean.</p>
			<p>That alone proved how terrifying the light curtain was.</p>
			<p>Retrieving a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein, Huang Xiaolong supplied the grand formation with endless energy. Only then did the shaking stop.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued onwards carefully.</p>
			<p>The further he got, the stronger the light became. Now, his pace was slowed to the speed of a crawl.</p>
			<p>Several dozen years passed once again. Finally, Huang Xiaolong crossed the barrier of light.</p>
			<p>The moment he did, Huang Xiaolong gasped in fright. He entered another universe and signs of life were everywhere to be seen. It was as though he entered the Thirteen Universes once again.</p>
			<p>Even so, he was extremely sure that the place before him wasn’t the Thirteen Universes he came from!</p>
			<p>The spiritual energy was even purer than that in the Thirteen Universes, and there was a special type of power contained in the air.</p>
			<p>The laws of the universe were much stronger there than in the Thirteen Universes!</p>
			<p>“Is this the Universe Origin?!”</p>
			<p>He finally arrived! </p>
			<p>A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</p>
			<p>Even after taking so much time, he arrived!</p>
			<p>A moment later, Huang Xiaolong suppressed his excitement and continued onwards.</p>
			<p>Several days later, he saw a spatial black hole sitting in the middle of space.</p>
			<p>Without a second though, he entered the black hole.</p>
			<p>When he arrived on the other side, he was greeted with a scenery greater than that in the Universe Vault.</p>
			<p>Taking a deep breath, Huang Xiaolong felt extremely comfortable. He continued on his way onwards.</p>
			<p>Soon, he arrived before a giant primitive forest.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls and even though he couldn’t cover the entire area, he knew that it was larger than whatever forest he found in the Thirteen Universes.</p>
			<p>There were ferocious beasts at the God of Creation Realm within.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s figure started to blur as he appeared above the beast he discovered. With a swing of his arm, he pulled the beast over and invaded its soul with his own. He could feel an extremely pure energy in its body. It was a combination of grandmist energy and universe source qi.</p>
			<p>The beast’s physical body was different from that of the creatures in the Thirteen Universes. The beast was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, and it barely broke through. However, its body was stronger than experts who had 15 billion units of combat strength back in the Thirteen Universes. </p>
			<p>The runes that lined its body contained exquisite grand dao laws.</p>
			<p>The beast stared at Huang Xiaolong in fear and yelled, “Senior, please spare my life!” </p>
			<p>“Relax. I won’t do anything to you.” Huang Xiaolong chucked and branded its soul. </p>
			<p>As he came alone, he needed to find a suitable mount after entering the Universe Origin.</p>
			<p>After controlling the beast, he looked through its memories.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong learned that the beast and everyone who lived there called the place the Origin Universe!</p>
			<p>Creatures there were called Origin Beasts, and there were countless ancient races. Other than Humans, there were many different life forms. The Origin Universe was larger than any of the thirteen universes.</p>
			<p>Even though the creature was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, it had no idea how large the Origin Universe Was. It only knew that one person had ever entered the Universe Origin.</p>
			<p>What shocked Huang Xiaolong was the fact that the beast knew the way to enter the Universe God Realm!</p>
			<p>A massive palace would appear in a place called the Golden Valley and there was a mirror situated within. It contained the highest of laws in the Origin Universe, and legends had it that anyone who could comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror would be able to enter the Universe God Realm.</p>
			<p>From what it seemed, the palace would appear again in several hundred thousand years!</p>
			<p>“Is the place called the Devil Mirror Palace?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.</p>
			<p>Was it possible for the mirror in the palace to be similar to the one he obtained back in the Unknown Space? When Huang Xiaolong thought about the secrets contained in the Nameless Devil Mirror he realized that it was eerily similar to the mirror described in the beast’s memory!𝒇𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎</p>

				<p>Chapter 3738: Nine Cauldron Land</p>
			</title>
			<p>“So that’s what it is…” Huang Xiaolong felt as though a veil was lifted before him. He comprehended the mysteries behind the Nameless Devil Mirror, but he felt as though something was missing. </p>
			<p>Now, he finally understood.</p>
			<p>In order to break through to the Universe God Realm, it wasn’t enough to only comprehend the mysteries behind the Thirteen Universes. One also had to understand the laws of the Origin Universe!</p>
			<p>The Thirteen Universes were born from the Universe Origin, and they could be considered its child.</p>
			<p>As such, they would only be able to reach a state of perfection when they were combined!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief after his discovery.</p>
			<p>Without his Nameless Devil Mirror, it would be useless even if the Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune comprehended the mirror in the Devil Mirror Palace. Their chances of breaking through were slim to none.</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t discover anything about the Black Nether King or Old Man Fortune from the beast’s memories. It seemed as though they hadn’t arrived yet. Otherwise, they went into hiding the moment they did.</p>
			<p>A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It was too easy to obtain news on the Devil Mirror Palace. If either of them entered the Origin Universe, they would have learned of it too. When the palace appeared, they would definitely run into each other. </p>
			<p>The Devil Mirror Palace was split into the outer palace and the inner palace. The beast Huang Xiaolong caught had only been to the outer palace. The number of people who could enter the inner palace were peak experts in the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>According to what the beast knew, there were four regions surrounding them and only one expert was qualified to enter the inner palace. He was called the Heaven Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>He was an expert of the Human Race, and he was one of the ten strongest experts in the Origin Universe. He had 27 billion units of combat strength.</p>
			<p>“Heaven Sage Human Emperor…”</p>
			<p>As long as Huang Xiaolong found him, he would understand the situation in the inner palace. He could actually determine if the devil mirror was of the same type as his own! Moreover, comprehending the devil mirror would be much easier when he knew what was going to happen in there.</p>
			<p>The biggest problem was locating the other party!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the beast and flew deeper into the continent.</p>
			<p>The beast was called a Jade Eyed Beast and even in the Origin Universe, it was a supreme existence. It had an ancient supreme bloodline and it flew extremely quickly. It wasn’t any slower than the beasts in the Thirteen Universes that had 15 billion units of combat strength. If Pangu used his full strength, he would probably be as quick as the Jade Eyed Beast!</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong discovered a human being surrounded by two beasts on his way towards the central region. Casually saving the human, he subdued both beasts.</p>
			<p>The man was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. Comparable to Pangu in strength, the man wasn’t weak at all! As for the two beasts, they were both Golden Lions. One of them was male and the other was female. Their strength was comparable to the Jade Eyed Beast Huang Xiaolong rode on.</p>
			<p>Seeing as he was saved, the expert thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely, “Many thanks to senior for saving my life!” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong waved his arms casually. </p>
			<p>Soon after, the group of them traveled out of the forest.</p>
			<p>Along the way, Huang Xiaolong learned that the man was called Peng Xian, and he was the old ancestor of the Peng Family.</p>
			<p>The ancestor of the Peng Family entered the Heavenly Phoenix Forest in order to look for the egg of a Heavenly Phoenix. He wanted to refine a pill using the egg of the godly creature, and he managed to accomplish his goal. It was too bad he was discovered by the lions before he could leave.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian muttered in embarrassment, “If not for the senior’s help, I wouldn’t be able to leave this forest today.” </p>
			<p>It didn't take long for him to invite Huang Xiaolong to his Peng Family.</p>
			<p>“In a few days, I will be celebrating my ten-billionth birthday. I will invite the experts in the region over, and I hope that I will get the honor of hosting an esteemed senior in my family!” Peng Xian explained.</p>
			<p>Seeing the sincere expression on Peng Xian’s face, Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright, since I have nowhere to go anyway.” </p>
			<p>An awkward smile formed on Peng Xian’s face. “Senior definitely broke through the 10 billion combat abilities mark. How can you have nowhere to go?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled. </p>
			<p>Not planning to explain his strength, he spoke of his current situation. “I came to the Nine Cauldron Land not too long ago.”</p>
			<p>Peng Xian thought that Huang Xiaolong came from some other continent and asked, “Senior, are you also here to obtain the Nine Cauldrons?”</p>
			<p>“?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually.</p>
			<p>“There have been rumors that the Guardian Treasure will soon appear in the continent. Many experts have flocked over from all over the Origin Universe in order to try their luck at obtaining it,” Peng Xian explained. </p>
			<p>“So that’s the case…” Huang Xiaolong smiled.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong knew what a guardian treasure was. In the Origin Universe, every single continent had its own guardian treasure. There were some who obtained the guardian treasures of some random continent, and there were continents whose treasures remained ownerless.</p>
			<p>The Nine Cauldrons of the Nine Cauldron Land hadn’t been claimed by anyone, and it was an opportunity for the experts in the Origin Universe! </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong also knew that the strength of the guardian treasures was slightly worse than his universe treasures.</p>
			<p>Of course, they were still stronger than pseudo-universe treasures.</p>
			<p>Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Peng Family Manor.</p>
			<p>The manor was located in the Imperial Dragon City, and it was one of the largest cities in the Nine Cauldron Land. Peng Xian might be a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, but his family wasn’t considered part of the strongest few in the city. </p>
			<p>As Peng Xian had been around for ten billion years, there were several hundred experts attending his birthday celebration even though he wasn’t the old ancestor of a peak-level family.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaoong arrived, there was only a single day left until the banquet. As such, the festivities were in full swing. Several God of Creation Realm experts who arrived earlier had already entered the manor.𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝒏𝙤𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝙤𝒎</p>
			<p>Peng Xian personally arranged for Huang Xiaolong’s lodgings in the manor. </p>
			<p>Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had no other instructions, Peng Xian returned to his palace. </p>
			<p>As soon as he did, his son, Peng Ze, could be seen waiting in the main hall.</p>
			<p>“Father, you’re back!” Peng Ze bowed.</p>
			<p>Seeing the look on his son’s face, Peng Xian knew that something was up. “What’s going on?”</p>
			<p>After a slight hesitation, Peng Ze explained, “Father, I heard that Wang Kaifei from the Eastern Plains has returned…” </p>
			<p>“What?! He’s still alive?!” Peng Xian’s expression changed slightly.</p>
			<p>Wang Kaifei was the old ancestor of the Wang Family in the Imperial Dragon City. The Wang and Peng families had always been at odds. The Peng Family had always been weaker than them, and when the Wang Family’s old ancestor went out in search of opportunities, there were rumors saying that he died in recent years. </p>
			<p>As such, the Peng Family started suppressing the Wang Family in recent years.</p>
			<p>Who would have thought that Wang Kaifei would return?!</p>
			<p>As an existence who was a half-step Universe God, Wang Kaifei’s return spelled trouble for the Peng Family.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3739: Lord Shen An</p>
			</title>
			<p>“I heard that he didn’t return alone!” Peng Ze lowered his head and muttered.</p>
			<p>“What do you mean?” </p>
			<p>“He… He seemed to come back with Lord Shen An,” Peng Ze explained. His voice trembled slightly when he mentioned Shen An.</p>
			<p>“Lord Shen An?! Which Shen An are you talking about?” Peng Xian didn’t think too much about it and snapped in irritation.</p>
			<p>“Lord Shen An from the Heaven Sage Palace!” </p>
			<p>“What?! Heaven Sage Palace?!” Peng Xian yelled as he jumped to his feet.</p>
			<p>The Heaven Sage Palace was the holy land in the Nine Cauldron Land!</p>
			<p>The person who created the Heaven Sage Palace was the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, the expert whose combat strength crossed the 27 billion mark!</p>
			<p>To people like Peng Xian, there wasn’t even a need to mention the Heaven Sage Human Emperor! Anyone who crossed the 20 billion mark would be comparable to god in his eyes! </p>
			<p>Once Peng Ze mentioned where Shen An came from, Peng Xian’s mind raced to connect the dots. Shen An was the direct disciple of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor!</p>
			<p>“How can this happen?! What’s going on?!” Peng Xian yelled in shock. “How in the world did Wang Kaifei get acquainted with Lord Shen An? That’s not possible… Did you make a mistake somewhere?!” </p>
			<p>Peng Ze knew that his father was pushing his luck, but he had to explain the situation no matter the cost. “Wang Kaifei was said to have been saved by Lord Shen An back in the Eastern Plains. Lord Shen An looked highly upon him and quickly promoted Wang Kaifei to be his right-hand man.”</p>
			<p>Peng Xian’s expression changed drastically.</p>
			<p>“This… This might not be true, however, it’s extremely likely that’s what happened.” Peng Ze sighed.</p>
			<p>“Wang Kaifei returned to his manor just a moment ago, and Lord Shen An was invited in as a guest of honor,” Peng Ze continued. </p>
			<p>The last trace of hope in Peng Xian’s heart disappeared.</p>
			<p>Falling to the ground, Peng Xian felt the world crumbling around him.</p>
			<p>“Why… Why do the heavens wish to see my Peng Family destroyed?!” </p>
			<p>“Why!!!”</p>
			<p>“Did I do something to anger the heavens?!” </p>
			<p>Peng Ze felt tears welling up in his eyes when he saw the state his father was in.</p>
			<p>Since Huang Xiaolong remained in the inner palace, he didn’t bother going out to explore the city. He spent his time comprehending the Nameless Devil Mirror.</p>
			<p>As dawn broke the very next day, Peng Xian went over to Huang Xiaolong’s palace early in the morning. He might have hidden his expressions well, but Huang Xiaolong could see that he had a lot on his mind.</p>
			<p>Since Peng Xian didn’t wish to talk about it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t pry.</p>
			<p>After all, it probably had something to do with his family.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian quickly brought Huang Xiaolong over to the main palace.</p>
			<p>It was Peng Xian’s birthday, but he allowed Huang Xiaolong to take the seat of honor in the room. Of course, Huang Xiaolong could read the room. He didn’t wish to take the limelight away from the man celebrating his ten billionth birthday and he chose a seat on the left of the main throne of the hall.</p>
			<p>Even so, everyone was shocked to discover Peng Xian’s intention.</p>
			<p>They started to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity.</p>
			<p>“Could he be someone invited by the Peng Family? He might be a half-step Universe God…” </p>
			<p>“Even if he is, there’s no use! Who dares to offend the Heaven Sage Palace?! Wang Kaifei threw in his lot with Lord Shen An, and he’s someone under their banner now. Humph. Wang Kaifei will definitely show up later.”</p>
			<p>“If he does, we’ll be in for a treat.” </p>
			<p>Several experts spoke among themselves.</p>
			<p>Even though Peng Xian couldn’t hear what they said, nothing could be hidden from an expert at Huang Xiaolong’s level.</p>
			<p>“Heaven Sage Palace?” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. </p>
			<p>From their secret conversations, Huang Xiaolong could tell that the Wang Family was at loggerheads with the Peng Family. Moreover, he learned that Wang Kaifei just returned from the Eastern Plains after throwing in his lot with Shen An.</p>
			<p>The moment Peng Xian arrived, many people came up to present their gifts. However, the festivities were broken by a shrill cry as experts of the Peng Family were thrown into the hall. All of them suffered serious injuries, and there were some whose bodies were split wide open. Some of them also had sharp spikes stabbed straight through their eye sockets.</p>
			<p>The faces of Peng Xian and Peng Ze turned extremely ugly as the hall fell silent.</p>
			<p>Everyone could guess what was going on.</p>
			<p>Indeed, mocking laughter rang through the air. “Old Man Peng, it’s your birthday today and it’s weird that you didn’t invite me. I hope you don’t mind that I invited myself.” A middle-aged man clad in purple-gold battle robe strode into the hall followed by a group of experts from the Wang Family.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the person who came. </p>
			<p>It was none other than Wang Kaifei, the old ancestor of the Wang Family.</p>
			<p>The experts of the Peng Family no longer dared to stop him after the carnage he caused. They retreated over to Peng Xian’s side and the experts who came to offer their congratulations made their way to the side of the hall.</p>
			<p>“Wang Kaifei, what’s the meaning of this?!” Peng Xian growled as he looked at the disciples on the ground.</p>
			<p>Even though the Wang Family was strong, they wouldn’t dare to cripple the disciples of the Peng Family in their territory, much less, core disciples!</p>
			<p>“I don’t have any other intentions! I’m here to celebrate your birthday for you! In fact, I brought you a lavish gift!” As soon as he spoke, he gestured for someone to bring a metal case forward.</p>
			<p>A feeling of foreboding appeared in the hearts of Peng Xian and Peng Ze.</p>
			<p>Opening the lid, Wang Kaifei revealed the contents to everyone in the hall. It was the head of a man whose eyes were filled with indignation and hatred.</p>
			<p>“Tao’er!” Peng Ze screamed.</p>
			<p>That was the head of his son, Peng Tao!</p>
			<p>In a fit of rage, he wanted to charge at the members of the Wang Family but was stopped by Peng Xian. </p>
			<p>Staring at Wang Kaifei, Peng Xian growled, “Where is my grandson’s dao soul?”</p>

			<p>Peng Ze roared with rage, “Wang Kaifei, the grudge between our families will never be buried!”</p>
			<p>Killing intent filled Peng Xian’s heart, and he snapped, “Wang Kaifei, aren’t you afraid that I’ll do the same to your son and grandson?!” Even though Wang Kaifei had been missing for a long time, the Peng Family merely suppressed their businesses.

			<p>Wang Kaifei sneered, “Peng Xian, do you really think that you will get the chance to do anything? Today might be your birthday, but it’ll be the anniversary of your Peng Family’s extermination in a year!” </p>
			<p>Several figures appeared around the manor after he spoke.</p>

			<p>The members who arrived were precisely members of the Heaven Sage Palace.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3740: Control Yourself</p>
			</title>
			<p>Terror appeared in the eyes of the disciples of the Peng Family.</p>
			<p>One of the God of Creation Realm experts who came to the banquet asked in haste, “Brother Wang, we might have come to celebrate his birthday, but we’re not related to the Peng Family!” </p>
			<p>Many other experts started to explain themselves in succession. All of them drew a clear line with the Peng Family.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian roared with anger, “You…”</p>
			<p>All of them were friends he made in the past. Who would have thought that they would leave the Peng Family to die in the slightest bit of trouble?</p>
			<p>Someone in the crowd sneered, “Peng Xian, you can’t blame us for this! You offended the Heaven Sage Palace on your own! You can only blame yourself!” 𝓯𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>Wang Kaifei clapped and laughed, “Did you hear that? You can only blame yourself for your bad luck!” </p>
			<p>Peng Xian’s expression sank as he glared at Wang Kaifei.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace released their aura and locked on to the members of the Peng Family. As long as anyone tried anything funny, they would be killed. </p>
			<p>Wang Kaifei swept his gaze across the hall and saw a young man casually sipping on his tea and his expression turned dark. “Who would have thought that there would be a dumb*ss who doesn’t know how to read the room?” </p>
			<p>Wang Kaifei was extremely unhappy to see that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t flustered at all.</p>
			<p>Even though he had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was, he could tell that he was a guest invited by Peng Xian. According to him, Peng Xian wouldn’t be able to invite anyone important. As such, he felt that everyone in the hall was merely peasants. After all, he was someone from the Heaven Sage Palace now.</p>
			<p>Those standing around burst out laughing when they heard what Wang Kaifei said.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong raised his head and snorted coldly, “Slap him.”</p>
			<p>Slap him?!</p>
			<p>Before Wang Kaifei could retort, a fine hand appeared in the skies and slapped him across the face. He was sent flying out of the hall and he landed heavily on the platform outside. Cracks formed in the ground.</p>
			<p>Everyone stared at Wang Kaifei in shock.</p>
			<p>?!</p>
			<p>The gaze in their eyes changed when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The ancestors who were in the hall quickly drew their distance from Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Despite his obvious attack, no one saw how Huang Xiaolong did it.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian was unable to see what he did, and neither could the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace.</p>
			<p>The four half-step Universe Gods felt their pupils shrinking when they looked at Huang Xiaolong once again. </p>
			<p>The experts of the Wang Family felt their hearts pounding in their chests as they stood rooted in place.</p>
			<p>Crawling to his feet, Wang Kaifei felt that his entire body was in shambles. The slap earlier caused all the teeth in his mouth to fall out.</p>
			<p>“You!” Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, Wang Kaifei roared with rage. He was someone who served Lord Shen An of the Heaven Sage Palace. After he returned from the Eastern Plains, he had never suffered from such disrespect!</p>
			<p>“Kneel,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.</p>
			<p>Next, Wang Kaifei felt a formless pressure that contained the weight of the world crashing down on his shoulders. Falling to his knees, he realized that he couldn’t move a single muscle! </p>
			<p>His knees shattered the rocks beneath his feet.</p>
			<p>The faces of those standing around changed once again.</p>
			<p>Silence fell on the Peng Family Manor.</p>
			<p>One of the four experts from the Heaven Sage Palace spoke up all of a sudden. “No matter who you are, you better control yourself! Right now, Wang Kaifei is someone who works for Lord Shen An! He’s someone from our Heaven Sage Palace! You…” </p>
			<p>Before he could finish his sentence, Huang Xiaolong sighted, “If you wish to speak to me, get down here!” </p>
			<p>Another formless arm appeared in the skies to send the four of them slamming into the ground.</p>
			<p>Gasps filled the air.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian was shocked.</p>
			<p>He thought that Huang Xiaolong might be someone who crossed the 10 billion mark, but from what it seemed, Huang Xiaolong was much stronger than he thought!</p>
			<p>No ordinary expert who barely broke through the 10 billion mark could drive four half-step Universe Gods into the ground.</p>
			<p>Is he someone who reached the 11 billion unit mark? </p>
			<p>Or perhaps, 12 billion units…</p>
			<p>Expressions of rage could be seen on their faces when they crawled to their feet.</p>
			<p>“Who do you think you are?! Do you know what will happen if you choose to go against our Heaven Sage Palace?!” the person who spoke earlier snapped at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Oh, why don’t you tell me what will happen?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled before placing his cup down on the table.</p>
			<p>When the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace saw that, they felt as though something bad was about to happen. Hesitating slightly, he eventually snorted in irritation, “Don’t get cocky, Lord Shen An is currently in the city!”</p>
			<p>It was true. Shen An was in the Wang Family Manor and he sent four experts to follow Wang Kaifei. From his estimates, they were more than enough to destroy the Peng Family Manor many times over.</p>
			<p>As such, he didn’t bother showing up personally.</p>
			<p>Shen An was the direct disciple of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, and he was extremely famous in the region. He had 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy! </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong released his dao soul and covered the entire city. Flicking his finger slightly, a hole appeared in the void and several figures came crashing down.</p>
			<p>When the experts in the hall saw the arrival of the newcomers, they were shocked.</p>
			<p>“Lord… Lord Shen An?!” </p>
			<p>The people Huang Xiaolong dragged over were Shen An and his subordinates! There were five people in total, and all of them were brought over in an instant.</p>
			<p>Just a moment ago, Shen An and the others were discussing matters about the Nine Cauldrons when they felt the space around their body tightening up. They couldn’t move as the world started to spin around them. The next thing they knew, they were in the main hall of the Peng Family.</p>
			<p>Looking around, Shen An was shocked to discover the four experts he sent over with Wang Kaifei.</p>
			<p>“What’s going…” Before Shen An could ask his question, Huang Xiaolong interrupted him. “Are you Shen An?”</p>
			<p>Shen An spun around only to be confronted by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>One of the experts who came with Wang Kaifei ran over hastily to tell Shen An everything that went down.</p>
			<p>When he was done, a look of suspicion appeared in Shen An’s eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong cautiously.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3741: The Nine Cauldrons Appears</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Who are you?” Shen An asked Huang Xiaolong in a dignified manner, “What matters have you got for calling me over?”</p>
			<p>What matters have you got? Despite sounding polite, it was clear from his tone that he was in fact, questioning Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>As Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s grand-disciple, he was called over by Huang Xiaolong for no good reason, and on top of that, he plummeted from high air, denting his image. This made Shen An extremely displeased, and if it wasn’t for the fact that he was wary of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he would have attacked Huang Xiaolong by now. </p>
			<p>Detecting Shen An’s questioning tone towards him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to answer. His hand reached out and grabbed Shen An from across space towards him. </p>
			<p>Shen An panicked for a split second and was about to retaliate and break free from Huang Xiaolong’s grasp, but he discovered he couldn’t move at all.𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝔀𝒆𝒃𝒏𝓸𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝙢</p>
			<p>“What are you doing?!” Shen An roared angrily in a reflex reaction.</p>
			<p>“Lord Shen An!”</p>
			<p>“Everyone attack, rescue Lord Shen An!” Heaven Saint Palace’s several half-step Universe Gods bellowed in anger towards the surrounding Wang Family’s experts while they themselves pounced towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Seeing this, the present Wang Family also attacked Huang Xiaolong.  </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed and disinterested, as he remained seated. With a wave of his hand, he sent all the Heaven Saint Palace and Wang Family’s experts flying out, crashing down on the street outside of the Peng Family Manor. For a moment, screams and shrieks reverberated through the street.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian and the other Gods of Creation couldn’t hide their shock.</p>
			<p>Ignoring the terror-filled expressions on Peng Xian’s and other Gods of Creation’s faces, Huang Xiaolong directly conducted soul searching on Shen An.</p>
			<p>Shen An and the Saint Heaven Palace’s experts had come to Nine Cauldron Land when the Nine Cauldrons were about to appear, and they did so probably under the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s order to survey the situation.</p>
			<p>A while later, Huang Xiaolong’s soul searching came to an end.</p>
			<p>From Shen An’s memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that he had indeed come here under the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s order to inquire about the Nine Cauldrons. Not only Shen An, but also Shen An’s master, and several of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s personal disciples had also come to the Nine Cauldron Land under his order. However, the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s personal disciples did not travel together with Shen An. </p>
			<p>Neither Shen An nor his master knew the whereabouts of the Heaven Saint Human Emperor. </p>
			<p>But one thing was certain that when the Guardian Treasure Nine Cauldrons appeared, the Heaven Sage Human Emperor would appear as well. </p>
			<p>So, Huang Xiaolong only needed to concentrate on inquiring about the Nine Cauldrons, and it would soon lead him to the Heaven Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong then turned his attention to the many Gods of Creation in the hall.</p>
			<p>Deterred by the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown thus far, the Gods of Creation who had come to participate in the birthday banquet had withdrawn to the sides of the hall. Their hearts tightened as Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept past them. </p>
			<p>An overwhelming aura spread from Huang Xiaolong’s body, covering the entire Peng Family Manor, and every person within the manor crouched to the ground in fear.</p>
			<p>With a casual wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand, all these present Gods of Creation’s dao souls were instantly branded by his dao soul mark.</p>
			<p>Although these God of Creation experts weren’t all that powerful, none of them had battle power above ten billion, but fortunately, there was a large number of people, over seven to eight hundred of them. With these people helping him to inquire news, Huang Xiaolong would immediately know once the Nine Cauldrons appeared. </p>
			<p>As for Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and experts from the Saint Heaven Palace, and Wang Family, Huang Xiaolong put all of them under his control as one more person added a little bit more strength.</p>
			<p>“Go look for clues,” Huang Xiaolong ordered after he had everyone under his control, sending everyone out to search for news and clues related to the Nine Cauldrons. </p>
			<p>The Gods of Creation complied and each sped away after respectfully saluting Huang Xiaolong. With their departures, the Peng Family Manor was much quieter. </p>
			<p>Peng Xian, Peng Ze, and the others stood nervously, looking ill at ease.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the nervous Peng Xian, chuckling softly, “Peng Xian, I have disturbed your birthday celebration banquet, so take this peak-grade universe origin spiritual vein as compensation.” He took out a peak-grade universe origin spiritual vein as he said so.</p>
			<p>Peng Xian panicked hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, shaking his hands in a hurry. “No, no, Lord, you subdued Wang Kaifei and the others, saving our Peng Family from top to bottom. I, Peng Xian, am unable to repay your grace. How could I take any compensation from you? If the Lord does not mind, the Peng Family is willing to serve you with all we can!”</p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong had branded Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and the others’ dao souls with his soul mark, he had skipped the Peng Family in the process. </p>
			<p>At Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he wasn’t afraid that any of the Peng Family would leak a word out about him.</p>
			<p>Looking at the group of Peng Family’s experts kneeling on the floor, Huang Xiaolong told them to stand up, and he nodded his head in agreement to the Peng Family’s submission. </p>
			<p>Upon obtaining Huang Xiaolong’s acceptance, Peng Xian was thrilled beyond words, and kowtowed in gratitude to Huang Xiaolong. Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and the others were forcefully controlled by Huang Xiaolong, whereas their Peng Family submitted voluntarily. Hence, the Peng Family’s status in front of Huang Xiaolong was naturally different.</p>
			<p>After accepting Peng Xian’s submission, Huang Xiaolong gave him the peak-grade universe-origin spiritual vein he had taken out earlier. Peng Xian hesitated but accepted it in the end, and got down on his knees again, thanking Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stayed at the Peng Family Manor as he waited for news. In the meantime, he began studying the Nameless Devil Mirror’s thirteen universes’ esoterics and laws.</p>
			<p>As news of the Nine Cauldrons’ impending appearance spread, there was an influx of God of Creation experts from other lands into the Nine Cauldron Land. At any other time, experts breaking the ten billion mark rarely appear in public in a million years, but now, with the rumors of the Nine Cauldron appearing, even experts of twenty billion mark had emerged from seclusions.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about these influxes of the Gods of Creation into the Nine Cauldron Land as he was only concerned about the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s whereabouts at the moment. </p>
			<p>Two months went by in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>On this day, Huang Xiaolong suddenly received a message from Shen An.</p>
			<p>“The Nine Cauldron has appeared! At the Big River Mountain!” Huang Xiaolong stood up immediately after reading the message.</p>
			<p>The Big River Mountain was a famous strange mountain in the Nine Cauldron Land, and it was located a short distance from the Imperial Dragon City. On the Universe Boat at full speed, it would only take three to four days.</p>
			<p>Without wasting time, Huang Xiaolong tore up space and left the Peng Family Manor.</p>
			<p>After Huang Xiaolong left the Peng Family Manor, he took out the Universe Boat and sailed it to its fastest speed towards the Big River Mountain.</p>
			<p>Under Huang Xiaolong’s effort, the Universe Boat turned into a streak of golden light, traversing through space at unbelievable speed that even experts of ten billion mark wouldn’t be able to capture the boat’s movements. Experts across these cities merely detected strong ripples in space, but it recovered almost immediately, causing them to think they probably hallucinated it.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong finally reached the Big River Mountain three days later, the area was already crowded with experts from various forces. On the mountain peaks nearby,experts were gathered from various celestial empires and cities, and there were experts from the Nine Cauldron Land as well as other lands.</p>
			<p>There was a crystal clear river winding around the Big River Mountain with the waters roiling endlessly. At this time, the river surface was boiling and there were rays of auspicious light shining from the bottom of the river. This was a clear sign that a treasure was about to appear. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was calm. He did not check out the river but spread his senses, staying alert as he waited for the Heaven Sage Human Emperor to appear.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3742: Do You Know Who You Are Talking To?</p>
			</title>
			<p>More experts arrived at the Big River Mountain as time passed, and amongst them weren’t any hegemons with less resounding reputations.</p>
			<p>“Old Granny Void!”</p>
			<p>The crowd stirred when an abrupt cry rang in the air as an old woman with a head of gray-silver hair approached from the distant sky, holding a cane with a dragon head carving as the grip. She was born with a pair of clear-cut phoenix eyes, and despite her gray-silver hair, her complexion was ruddy, and she didn’t look older than a middle-aged woman in her fifties, exuding an indescribable allure and charm.</p>
			<p>Old Granny Void was not a native of Nine Cauldron Land. She was an expert of twenty-billion mark from the neighboring land. Even though her reputation was not as loud as the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, she was capable of holding her own, and she was a supreme existence who could deter many other similar experts in this region.</p>
			<p>In the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and Jian Wushuang were the only six experts who had broken the twenty billionth mark. However, there were certainly more such experts in the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>Though they were not as many as the white cabbages sold on the streets, there were at least two such experts on each land.</p>
			<p>Old Granny Void’s arrival seemed to dampen the atmosphere slightly.</p>
			<p>“Even an expert like Old Granny Void has come, so we definitely have no hope of getting the Nine Cauldrons.” </p>
			<p>“I’ve heard even Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor would come in person!” </p>
			<p>“What?! Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor?!!”</p>
			<p>“That’s right, Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor is obsessed with refining pills, and he has been searching for a suitable divine cauldron. Now that the Nine Cauldrons is about to appear, isn’t it natural that he is tempted? He sent Saint Heaven Palace’s experts to inquire about the Nine Cauldrons’ appearance a few months back.” 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝒃𝙣𝓸𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>Hearing that the Heaven Sage Human Emperor might appear in person, families’ patriarchs grasping on a stroke of luck nipped their thoughts in the buds.</p>
			<p>Although there was a saying that a peerless treasure like the Nine Cauldrons would choose the fated person, this kind of saying, fate or even luck were irrelevant before a supreme expert like the Heaven Sage Human.</p>
			<p>Who had the guts to compete for the Nine Cauldrons against an expert like the Heaven Sage Human Emperor? Wasn’t that the same as banging one’s head at the door with a fervor, looking to die?</p>
			<p>While experts in the crowd talked in hushed whispers, a powerful momentum approached from the horizon, and this powerful momentum swept through the land.</p>
			<p>A middle-aged man of burly build and imposing aura, carrying a big blade, arrived with the wind howling behind him. </p>
			<p>Everyone froze when this person appeared, even Old Granny Void’s nonchalant expression stiffened slightly.</p>
			<p>“Domineering Blade Xihu!”</p>
			<p>The Domineering Blade Xihu was another twenty billion mark expert. In fact, he had reached the twenty-one billion mark, which was above Old Granny Void. </p>
			<p>It was not strange that Old Granny Void didn’t appreciate Domineering Blade Xihu appearing in this place at this time.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong watched as he waited calmly.</p>
			<p>As time passed, three more experts of the twenty-billion mark appeared.</p>
			<p>One of them, the Supreme Golden Devourer, had also reached the twenty-one billion mark. </p>
			<p>Until now, five experts with twenty billion mark and above had arrived, keeping the ancient races’ experts and families’ patriarchs at the ten billion mark fidgeting on their toes. The initially rowdy crowd had quieted down considerably.</p>
			<p>Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three stood high in the air above the Big River Mountain’s winding river, staring fixedly at the river. </p>
			<p>The auspicious rays shining out from the riverbed had grown stronger and brighter, as if signaling that the Nine Cauldrons was very close to emerging. It wouldn't take more than ten minutes.</p>
			<p>Experts waiting on the surrounding mountain peaks looked on with feverish gazes, but none of them dared to move closer because of the five experts in the air, and all they could do was watch from afar.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong too was watching from a distance away.</p>
			<p>Looking at the increasingly strong rays of light from the river, Huang Xiaolong frowned. The Heaven Sage Human Emperor isn’t coming?</p>
			<p>The Nine Cauldrons was that close to surfacing, and if the Heaven Sage Human Emperor wanted this cauldron, he should have arrived by now.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls’ senses spread, but he still did not detect the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s aura. </p>
			<p>Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to recover his dao souls’ power, he let out a low exclamation of surprise. He looked towards the horizon and saw a majestic palace flying in the Big River Mountain’s direction. </p>
			<p>This palace was more than enormous and obnoxiously enormous. Precious materials were inlaid on the roofs and walls of the palace, exceeding thousands in number, and they were glowing of prism colors. These precious materials were nothing in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, but to experts of twenty billion mark, any one of these items was a significant temptation.</p>
			<p>The present Gods of Creation were stunned for a second, but the faces of several families’ ancestors changed greatly as they recognized the owner of the palace.</p>
			<p>Even Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three looked unprecedentedly solemn.</p>
			<p>“Treasure Saint Palace!”</p>
			<p>Treasure Saint Palace!</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palace!</p>
			<p>There were numerous ancient races in the Origin Universe, and the human race was the biggest race. The human race had ten Human Emperors, and so far, they were entitled the human race’s ten most powerful experts.</p>
			<p>The Heaven Sage Human Emperor that Huang Xiaolong was searching for was an expert breaking the twenty-seven billionth mark, but amongst the ten Human Emperors, he ranked at the bottom ten.</p>
			<p>Whereas, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor ranked sixth among the ten Human Emperors!</p>
			<p>He was an expert breaking the twenty-eight billionth mark. More accurately, it was the 28.2 billion mark.</p>
			<p>Since the Treasure Saint Palace had arrived, inside had to be the Treasure Sage Human Emperor!</p>
			<p>This explained the ugly expressions on Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the others’ faces. </p>
			<p>Although the five of them were experts of twenty-billion mark, it was the devastating truth that the five of them were only worth one palm strike from the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Saint Palace’s speed didn’t seem to be very fast, but before it arrived, a large part of the crowd of experts were kneeling on their knees in salute. </p>
			<p>Even patriarchs with nineteen-billion mark were on their knees, only Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the other three dared to remain standing at this point.</p>
			<p>Even so, the five of them lowered their heads, bowing to show respect towards the Treasure Sage Human Emperor. </p>
			<p>Only Huang Xiaolong stood straight as if he didn’t notice the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s arrival.</p>
			<p>Many noticed Huang Xiaolong and were flabbergasted.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was one of the human race’s top ten Human Emperors. He was the pillar of strength and belief of the human race. Some present families’ patriarchs and ancient races’ patriarchs were outraged that Huang Xiaolong didn’t salute to show proper respect for the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Before anyone could utter a word, the crowd saw Huang Xiaolong take a step forward in the Treasure Saint Palace’s direction.</p>
			<p>Everyone looked like the cat had got their tongues. </p>
			<p>Old Granny Void and the others exchanged a baffled look, each thinking the same thing. Is this young man related to the Treasure Sage Human Emperor? </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of the flying palace while everyone had still to react. As the Treasure Saint Palace looked like it was going to ram into Huang Xiaolong, an invisible power surged out from his body, directly stopping the Treasure Saint Palace in its tracks.</p>
			<p>“Ei!” A low exclamation of surprise sounded from inside the Treasure Saint Palace. </p>
			<p>Old Granny Void was genuinely shocked that Huang Xiaolong stopped the Treasure Saint Palace in its tracks. </p>
			<p>“Young man, which family are you from?” From inside the Treasure Saint Palace, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s majestic voice sounded. The questioning and condescending manner in his tone was obvious to all.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong did not answer. Instead, he stated placidly, “The Heaven Sage Human Emperor must have known that you’re coming that he didn’t show up, but even though it’s you, the result will be the same.”</p>
			<p>It was because the Treasure Sage Human Emperor too had entered the inner hall of the Devil Mirror Palace.</p>
			<p>Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s words that made no sense in their ears, the crowd showed similar baffled expressions.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued, “My question to you is, what did you see after entering the Devil Mirror Palace? Describe to me in detail everything you saw inside the Devil Mirror Palace.”</p>
			<p>Laughter came from inside the Treasure Saint Palace. “I am to describe everything to you in detail? Listening to your tone, it sounds like I have no choice but to do as you say. Young man, do you know who you’re talking to?”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3743: From Under Which Rock Did He Crawl Out?</p>
			</title>
			<p>The calmness on Huang Xiaolong’s face remained as it was. “Then, do you know who are you talking to?”</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was taken aback as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s fearless attitude, and his nonchalant tone. He sounded a little surprised as he asked, “Who are you then?”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong stated his name.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong? 𝓯𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝒃𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor and the surrounding experts were slightly dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>One of the family’s old ancestors laughed abruptly, “Here I was thinking this brat is some world-shaking big shot!” He then joked with the experts close to him, “Huang Xiaolong? Have you guys heard of him?”</p>
			<p>Those around him shook their heads.</p>
			<p>“Never heard of him!” Another family’s old ancestor snickered, “Probably crawled out from under a rock somewhere!”</p>
			<p>More joined in the laughter. </p>
			<p>Even Old Granny Void and the other four couldn’t resist raising the corners of their mouths.</p>
			<p>“Master, please allow this disciple to send this person packing so as not to disturb the master anymore.” At this time, a clear voice of a female disciple inside the Treasure Saint Palace traveled out. Obviously, she was one of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s female disciples.</p>
			<p>“Alright,” the Treasure Sage Human Emperor agreed with a nod of his head.</p>
			<p>Right at this time, the auspicious rays from the river intensified a notch, and the vigorous flowing currents split in the middle as a giant golden cauldron soared out from the river.</p>
			<p>“It’s the guardian treasure, Nine Cauldrons!” A voice cut across the air.</p>
			<p>The various families’ and ancient races’ old ancestors immediately became spirited, searching the air with burning gazes.</p>
			<p>Although the present families’ and ancient races’ patriarchs revealed their desires, no one dared to make a move, including Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and others. The five people looked towards the Treasure Saint Palace. </p>
			<p>Seeing that the Nine Cauldrons had emerged from the river, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor couldn’t be bothered with Huang Xiaolong anymore. His palm reached out to grab the golden cauldron but there was someone faster than him. The suction force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm latched onto the Nine Cauldrons and pulled it back towards him. As it flew towards Huang Xiaolong, the Nine Cauldrons shrunk in size, being suppressed by Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds’ cosmos energy.</p>
			<p>This action completely stunned everyone present.</p>
			<p>“Preposterous!”</p>
			<p>“Courting death!”</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human was furious that a brat dared to compete with him for the Nine Cauldrons, and his palms struck towards Huang Xiaolong across space. A mountain-sized palm imprint appeared and slapped down on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>As a supreme expert breaking the 28.2 billion mark, one could imagine the force of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack in a fury. Watching the palm imprint falling down on Huang Xiaolong, Old Granny Void and the others backed away in panic, afraid they would be implicated by the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the palm imprint that was falling down on him, but he was clearly unperturbed. He raised his hand that went straight through and unimpeded the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palm force!</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palm force brushed against Huang Xiaolong’s palm like a gentle breeze.</p>
			<p>Then, everyone saw Huang Xiaolong easily pulling a person out of the Treasure Saint Palace and flinging him down on the Big River Mountain.</p>
			<p>The Big River Mountain rumbled and quaked, and cracks began to run across the indomitable Big River Mountain that had been standing since ancient times. Cracks large and small started from the mountain peak and spread in all directions.</p>
			<p>But the crowd’s attention was not on the Big River Mountain. Instead, all gazes were fixed on the person that Huang Xiaolong dug out from the Treasure Saint Palace and flung onto the Big River Mountain!</p>
			<p>The person who Huang Xiaolong threw onto the Big River Mountain was someone clad in golden-purple brocade robe embroidered with a majestic dragon. There was an imperial and unique treasure qi around the middle-aged man. </p>
			<p>“Treasure Sage Human Emperor!” Old Granny Void shrieked in astonishment.</p>
			<p>The middle-aged man pulled out by Huang Xiaolong from the Treasure Saint Palace was none other than the Treasure Sage Human Emperor himself! </p>
			<p>Those who had never seen the Treasure Sage Human Emperor ashened when they heard Old Granny Void’s high-pitched shriek.</p>
			<p>That person thrown onto the Big River Mountain peak, looking disheveled and covered in dust, is the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?!</p>
			<p>Looking at Huang Xiaolong again, the various families’ and ancient races’ old ancestors’ hearts gave birth to fear. It wasEspecially the few that mocked Huang Xiaolong and said he crawled out from under a rock earlier, looking pale as a ghost.</p>
			<p>Almost at the same time, several figures flew out from the Treasure Saint Palace in a hurry.</p>
			<p>“Master!”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty!”</p>
			<p>For a moment, the Treasure Saint Palace’s experts were running around like headless flies, unsure of what to do.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor raised his hand, signaling the Treasure Saint Palace’s experts not to come over as he got up from the ground. Dazzling lights rippled over him, as he shook off the dust and dirt off him.</p>
			<p>Under the crowd’s attention, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s robe fluttered without wind, and a golden light gleamed in his pupils. His unique treasure qi soared to the sky and ten thousand precious pearls appeared around him.</p>
			<p>It was a myriad of pearls.</p>
			<p>There were the primordial dragon pearl, Eye of Qilin, and Heart of the Golden Phoenix amongst these pearls, exuding an overwhelming coercive aura.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was called the Treasure Saint because he had a habit of collecting all kinds of treasures, and his main preference was collecting all kinds of precious and powerful pearls in the world. He then proceeded to forge these pearls into an unfathomable grand formation consisting of ten thousand pearls!</p>
			<p>Some claimed this pearl formation was stronger than any guardian treasures. </p>
			<p>However, only a few people had actually seen the Treasure Sage Human Emperor using this set of pearl formations, because there were even fewer people that could make the Treasure Sage Human Emperor resort to using it.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s body slowly rose into the air, and the thousands of pearls around him rose with him, flying in circles around him and glowing in various colors.</p>
			<p>“I very rarely use this set of pearl formation,” the Treasure Sage Human Emperor said with a deadpan expression as he looked straight at Huang Xiaolong. “Ever since it was successfully refined, I have only used it twice, and today is the third time!”</p>
			<p>His original plan was to get the Nine Cauldrons to reforge this set of pearl formations to increase its power to another degree. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong glanced at the glowing pearls around him, and stated placidly, “You only have one chance to attack!”</p>
			<p>Every single of these pearls contained amazing power, and it was even more so after being forged into one grand formation. But in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, it was nothing more than a decoration, and it was even worse than his collection of universe treasures.</p>
			<p>Hearing Huang Xiaolong say that he only had one chance to attack, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s face distorted for a split second. He had never been so insulted, and even the top of the ten Human Emperors, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, had never underestimated him like this.</p>
			<p>Treasure Sage Human Emperor spurred the cosmos energy of his world, and glaring lights burst out from the pearls around him as he activated the formation.</p>
			<p>Glaring rays convened in midair and shot towards Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong merely raised his hand and waved gently to disperse the beam of light coming at him. At the same time, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor appeared above Huang Xiaolong and directed the pearl formation to slam down.</p>
			<p>These pearls contained layers of formation inscribed personally by the Treasure Sage Human Emperor. They slammed down at full force, and the immediate space warped from pressure. The land under Huang Xiaolong’s feet was reduced to dust, turning into a bottomless abyss.</p>
			<p>But Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare a look at these pearls, and directly punched upwards, sending all the pearls flying. The pearls scattered and crashed in different directions, reducing mountains to rubble, and more than a few people spotted cracks on these pearls!</p>
			<p>After releasing one punch, Huang Xiaolong took a step forward and came face-to-face with the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Treasure Sage Human Emperor was shocked but reacted swiftly, punching out with both his fists.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3744: Abducting the Treasure Sage Human Emperor</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong let the fists land on his body, and at the same time, he struck out with his palm at the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Shocked faces dominated the crowd watching Huang Xiaolong’s action. Is that young man planning to exchange injury for injury against the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?</p>
			<p>When the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s fists landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, a barrier formed from the Thirteen Universes appeared around Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Boom!𝗳𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐰𝐞𝗯𝗻𝗼𝐯𝐞𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s fists’ force hit on the Thirteen Universes’ shadows instead.</p>
			<p>At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s palm directly sent Treasure Sage Human Emperor flying, smashing an enormous hole in the Big River Mountain base. The Big River Mountain that was already on the verge of crumbling with cracks running through it, completely crumbled into pieces.</p>
			<p>The crowd looked at the phantom images of the Thirteen Universes around Huang Xiaolong in astonishment and utter disbelief. Huang Xiaolong took on the full force of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s two punches and stood unscathed!</p>
			<p>In truth, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s punches did not hit Huang Xiaolong, hence, Huang Xiaolong was completely unaffected. The impact was blocked by the Thirteen Universes’ barrier.</p>
			<p>In recent years, Huang Xiaolong had been researching the esoterics and laws of the Nameless Devil Mirror’s Thirteen Universes, which contributed significantly to the perfection and completion of his own universe. Now, when Huang Xiaolong circulated the Universe Transformation Art, he could employ the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws to condense the thirteen universes’ barrier when facing his enemy. </p>
			<p>This was the first time Huang Xiaolong used the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws to form a barrier against his opponent, and its power greatly exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s estimation.</p>
			<p>Originally, Huang Xiaolong thought that the barrier could block most of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack and remnants of it would land on him, but the amount of energy that reached him just now was less than twenty percent. In other words, the Thirteen Universes’ barrier blocked off eighty percent of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s current physical defenses were more than sufficient to withstand twenty percent of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack, therefore, as everyone saw, he was unharmed.</p>
			<p>The shock Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three received after seeing Huang Xiaolong standing still unharmed was bigger than others present.</p>
			<p>Because they were clearer than other ancient races’ and families’ experts about how terrifying the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s strength was. Treasure Sage Human Emperor was born with an innate Treasure Physique. It was the highest grade of Treasure Physique in the entire Origin Universe, and it possessed formidable explosive power. Not to mention the various treasures the Treasure Sage Human Emperor had used over the years to temper and strengthen his body. Under the support of countless resources, his physical body was comparable to some 29.1 billion mark experts. Yet Huang Xiaolong was unscathed after being hit by his fists!</p>
			<p>On the contrary, it was the Treasure Sage Human Emperor who crashed into the bottom of Big River Mountain from Huang Xiaolong’s strike! </p>
			<p>Even though Treasure Sage Human Emperor was buried under a heap of rocks and stones, they spotted the palm print on his body! This palm print covered Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s entire torso, and his chest had caved in from the palm strike! </p>
			<p>Strong as Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s physique is, his chest actually caved in under that palm strike! Needless to say, all his ribs must be broken.</p>
			<p>The Treasure Saint Palace’s experts couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
			<p>The ten Human Emperors were the human race’s pillar of strength and belief in the Origin Universe, and Treasure Sage Human Emperor was the Treasure Saint Palace’s sky! </p>
			<p>Now, the sky had fallen.</p>
			<p>Fear and unease that they had never felt before gripped their hearts, making them feel lost, angry, and helpless, with all kinds of emotions jumbled up. </p>
			<p>Especially, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s one particular female disciple looked shocked and infuriated as she glared daggers at Huang Xiaolong. She was the one who said she’d pack Huang Xiaolong away so as not to disturb the Treasure Sage Human Emperor earlier.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the array of complicated, anguished faces of Treasure Saint Palace’s experts. After he put away the Nine Cauldrons, he arrived in front of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor in one step and pulled the man up into the air.</p>
			<p>“You—! Let go of my master!” the female disciple shouted as she rushed up toward Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>But before she even got closer, she was repelled by the pulse of energy from Huang Xiaolong’s body.</p>
			<p>Raising Treasure Sage Human Emperor up by the collar, Huang Xiaolong tore up space and disappeared from sight faster than one could blink.</p>
			<p>Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group wanted to chase after Huang Xiaolong by tracing his aura, but they soon discovered that both Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s aura had disappeared completely.</p>
			<p>The experts left behind looked at each other in confusion, wondering what they should do. </p>
			<p>Things ended… just like this?</p>
			<p>Neither Old Granny Void nor any of the other four experts got a chance to compete for the Nine Cauldrons, nor did Treasure Sage Human Emperor. All they knew was that the Nine Cauldron was taken away by a mysterious young man of unknown origins except that he was called Huang Xiaolong! </p>
			<p>Not only that, but the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was also injured and taken away!</p>
			<p>A human race expert of Treasure Sage Human Emperor level was taken away, and it was probably the first time something like this ever happened.</p>
			<p>“That Huang Xiaolong… Judging from his words, his target must have been the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, but since the Heaven Sage Human Emperor did not come, did the Treasure Sage Human Emperor became his substitute target?” Domineering Blade Xihu recalled what Huang Xiaolong said in the beginning and said it out loud.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong had blocked the Treasure Saint Palace’s path, he had mentioned that since the Heaven Sage Human Emperor had not come, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor would do as well.</p>
			<p>“What purpose does he have in taking away Lord Treasure Sage Human Emperor?” The Supreme Golden Devourer voiced his doubt. </p>
			<p>There’s a grudge between them?</p>
			<p>But it doesn’t look like it, because they do not know each other. Then, Huang Xiaolong did not come for vengeance. Had that been the case, he wouldn't have merely snatched away the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>“Perhaps, he wants to find out some secret from the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?” Old Granny Void deduced. She could probably guess what secret it related to.</p>
			<p>“Princess, what do we do now?” one of the Treasure Saint Palace’s Eminent Elder asked the female disciple.  </p>
			<p>“We will seek help from the Lord Dragon Sage Human Emperor to judge fairness for us!” The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s female disciple decided. </p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor was the most powerful of the human race’s cultivators, and he was an existence infinitely close to becoming the God of Universe. </p>
			<p>……</p>
			<p>Half a day after Huang Xiaolong took away Treasure Sage Human Emperor, they came to a desert island. He simply threw the Treasure Sage Human Emperor after sealing his strength.</p>
			<p>Treasure Sage Human Emperor glared ferociously at Huang Xiaolong from the ground. “Who are you really? Why did you kidnap me? We ten Human Emperors are of one mind. Therefore, kidnapping me means the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and the others will come hunting for you soon.”</p>
			<p>“Dragon Sage Human Emperor? I’m looking forward to meeting him,” Huang Xiaolong responded with a hint of apprehension.</p>
			<p>The Origin Universe’s Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s strength was comparable to Old Man Fortune, maybe even half a notch stronger than Old Man Fortune. If the Dragon Sage Human Emperor really came for him, Huang Xiaolong was truly interested to have a battle with him. </p>
			<p>Although the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was the number one human race expert, he was not the number one expert in the Origin Universe. In the whole Origin Universe, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor ranked second. </p>
			<p>After all, apart from the human race, there were countless other ancient races in the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong did not waste time talking about irrelevant matters with the Treasure Sage Human Emperor. He directly branded Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s dao soul with his soul mark, however, branding his soul mark in an expert at Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s level took a little bit more time and effort.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3745: Dragon Soul Mountain</p>
			</title>
			<p>Although the process required a little bit more time and effort than usual, it didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to successfully break through Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s dao soul’s defenses and brand it with his mark.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong then ‘viewed’ the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories.</p>
			<p>From Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories, Huang Xiaolong soon found the memories relevant to the Devil Mirror Palace.</p>
			<p>The nameless devil mirror inside the Devil Mirror Palace had five pointed corners like a pentagon, and it looked a little like the bagua that Huang Xiaolong was familiar with. The edges of the mirror were dense and there were intricate runes that seemed to originate from the same source as his nameless devil mirror. Runes, esoterics, and laws of the universe were all rolled into one.</p>
			<p>However, the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror was almost twice the size of his own nameless devil mirror, and other than that, there was no difference between the two. </p>
			<p>Upon confirming this, Huang Xiaolong’s heart raced.</p>
			<p>As he had guessed before, that devil mirror and his nameless mirror were like mother and son. If all details on both devil mirrors were exactly the same, and once he truly comprehended the Origin Universe, and the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws, he would be able to step into Universe God Realm.</p>
			<p>“Fragments of the devil mirror,” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath.</p>
			<p>From Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories, Huang Xiaolong also learned that there were three people who had obtained similar devil mirror fragments inside the Devil Mirror Palace’s inner hall. </p>
			<p>There was a rumor claiming that if one could completely comprehend the mysteries inside a devil mirror fragment, it would greatly raise one’s chances of comprehending the devil mirror itself.</p>
			<p>One of the three people who obtained a piece of devil mirror fragment was none other than the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Another person was the Lord of Ghost Desert, the third-ranked expert of the Origin Universe. His strength was only second to the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but his whereabouts had always been mysterious. From the beginning of Origin Universe to date, he hadn’t appeared more than ten times in public. </p>
			<p>The third and final person was the Origin Universe’s strongest cultivator, Yuan Fang!</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang was the monarch of all Orign Universe’s origin beasts!</p>
			<p>Yet, no one ever knew who origin beast Yuan Fang really was.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s pupils glimmered as he fell into contemplation. The Lord of Ghost Desert’s whereabouts were unknown, hence it was impossible for him to find him in a short time. Yuan Fang’s strength was no weaker than the Black Nether King, so it wouldn’t be easy for him to snatch the devil mirror fragment off Yuan Fang’s hand.</p>
			<p>Therefore, Huang Xiaolong set his sights on the target with the highest chance of succeeding, and he was none other than the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>As long as he obtained the devil mirror fragment, when coupled with his nameless devil mirror, comprehending the Origin Universe’s devil mirror would be easier. </p>
			<p>Prior to entering half-step Universe God, his strength was comparable to Old Man Fortune, and now that he had advanced to half-step Universe God, Huang Xiaolong was confident he was strong enough to suppress Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong decided against looking for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. Even though he could suppress the Dragon Sage Human Emperor with strength, he wasn’t absolutely certain that he could detain him.</p>
			<p>Currently, his comprehension of the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws within the nameless devil mirror had reached perfection, but his comprehension was not thorough enough. Huang Xiaolong believed he could do so within one hundred thousand years.</p>
			<p>His strength would rise to another degree at the time, and capturing and detaining the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be a certainty.</p>
			<p>Hence, Huang Xiaolong decided to push back looking for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor until he had thoroughly comprehended the devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes esoterics and laws.</p>
			<p>Thus, Huang Xiaolong quickly laid out a supreme formation around the island and entered seclusion on the third level of the Universe Boat. He continued to comprehend the nameless devil mirror within.</p>
			<p>As for the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, Huang Xiaolong threw him into one of the spaces inside the Universe Boat and left him at that.𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>Whilst Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion to further comprehend the devil mirror, the news that the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was injured by a youngster called Hunag Xiaolong shook the many lands in Origin Universe.  </p>
			<p>If it was a common twenty billion mark cultivator who was injured and whisked away, it naturally wouldn’t garner this degree of attention, but the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was one of the human race’s pillars of belief! On top of that, he was a supreme expert at the twenty-eight billion mark.</p>
			<p>Yet, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was injured by an unknown youngster called Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>The news shook the whole Origin Universe, and it had reached that magnitude.</p>
			<p>When news of it spread, all the top forces of Origin Universe went searching for Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s whereabouts.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor even appeared personally, and gathered the other eight of the human race’s Human Emperors to discuss the matter. Later on, with the Dragon Sage Human Emperor taking the lead, orders were issued from the nine Human Emperors to find Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor. </p>
			<p>Somewhere in a deserted mountainous terrain in the Origin Universe sat a person who seemed to be completely condensed from the darkness. Yes, he was pitch-black from head to toe, and his facial features were nonexistent nor did he seem to have any eyes. He was the epitome of darkness from head to toe. Despite the darkness of his body, it did not taint the environment, and yet it felt as if the whole mountainous terrain were enshrouded by indescribable darkness.</p>
			<p>“Heihei!”</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>“You’ve arrived at the Origin Universe at last!”</p>
			<p>“Looks like you’re also inquiring about the devil mirror, hopefully you won’t disappoint me when we meet again.”</p>
			<p>…… </p>
			<p>A hundred thousand years went by like a short dream.</p>
			<p>During this whole time, the Origin Universe’s human race cultivators had not given up on searching for Huang Xiaolong and the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, but their efforts bore no results.</p>
			<p>Even though they failed to locate Huang Xiaolong and the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, none of the human race’s forces gave up. All of them were still exerting efforts and were hellbent on finding Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>On this calm day out at the sea, glimmers of light lit up the surroundings of a certain deserted island, and moments later, a figure appeared.</p>
			<p>This person was Huang Xiaolong who had just come out of seclusion.</p>
			<p>In truth, he had thoroughly comprehended the nameless devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws several thousand years ago, and he had been solidifying his new state. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked around to get a bearing, then left the desert island in a streak of light, disappearing in the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>“Dragon Emperor Land!” He was Huang Xiaolong’s target this time.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Emperor Land was the sacred pilgrimage destination for the human race. It was the place with the biggest land surface in the Origin Universe, and also the land with the most experts. The Dragon Emperor Land was the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s territory.</p>
			<p>Similar to Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was human but possessed the dragon race’s bloodline.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong rushed to the Dragon Emperor Land on the Universe Boat without stopping. </p>
			<p>It was an understatement to say the Origin Universe was vast, and it took Huang Xiaolong more than a decade’s journey to reach the Dragon Emperor Land.</p>
			<p>Entering the Dragon Emperor Land, Huang Xiaolong could clearly feel the prosperity and vitality of the land. The architecture of the cities was decorated with one kind of dragon or another. </p>
			<p>“It is said that the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be present at the Dragon Soul Mountain’s awakening this time!”</p>
			<p>“The Golden Gorge’s Devil Mirror Palace is about to appear. Could the Dragon Sage Human Emperor intend to obtain the Dragon Soul Mountain's dragon soul source before the Devil Mirror Palace appears?” </p>
			<p>“Probably, if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor could obtain the dragon soul source and refine it, his chances of comprehending the devil mirror would increase.”</p>

				<p>Chapter 3746: Huang Xiaolong Is Also Here</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Dragon Soul Mountain?” Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was piqued immediately.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Soul Mountain was the Dragon Emperor Land’s sacred land, and within the Dragon Soul Mountain was the Origin Universe’s most ancient dragon soul. This dragon soul was born around the same time as the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but because of some circumstances or reason, this dragon soul had lost its physical body. </p>
			<p>This dragon soul had been living inside the Dragon Soul Mountain ever since, and it was referred to as the dragon source. If an expert with a dragon bloodline could capture this dragon soul to refine and absorb it, the benefits were unimaginable.</p>
			<p>However, absorbing and integrating the dragon soul into oneself was easier said than done, just like the Dragon Sage Human Emperor who had no success after so many years of trying.</p>
			<p>Due to the existence of this dragon soul source, many Dragon Race experts who lost their physical bodies in the Origin Universe would escape into the Dragon Soul Mountain to hide. As time passed, other than the initial dragon soul, there were other dragon souls of various levels in the Dragon Soul Mountain. </p>
			<p>At normal times, the Dragon Soul Mountain was enshrouded by the dragon soul source’s dragon qi. Hence, no one could enter the Dragon Soul Mountain. However, at every certain period, the dragon qi barrier around the Dragon Soul Mountain would weaken for some time. This is when the people outside the barrier said that Dragon Soul Mountain was awakening. During this awakening time frame, any God of Creation would be able to break into the Dragon Soul Mountain.</p>
			<p>Thus, during this time, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and many God of Creation experts would swarm into the Dragon Soul Mountain to look for dragon souls suitable for themselves in order to tame and absorb them. This was all for increasing their strength. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s pupils gleamed. Since the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be going to the Dragon Soul Mountain, he didn’t need to make the long trip to the Dragon Emperor City. </p>
			<p>His current location wasn’t far from the said Dragon Soul Mountain, and it would take Huang Xiaolong only half a month to reach the mountain at most.  </p>
			<p>Thus, Huang Xiaolong changed his destination and made his way to the Dragon Soul Mountain instead.</p>
			<p>Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong stood looking at the Dragon Soul Mountain some distance away.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Soul Mountain was actually a great mountain range that stretched into the horizon. At a single glance, one could hardly see the edge of it. No one could really tell how many miles of land made the Dragon Soul Mountain, except that the mountain range encompassed one-third of the Dragon Emperor Land!</p>
			<p>One-third of the land!</p>
			<p>On top of that, the Dragon Emperor Land has the biggest land surface in the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong reached the Dragon Soul Mountain, the Dragon Soul Mountain had already awakened. Experts from various corners of Dragon Emperor Land and Origin Universe had rushed inside.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong inquired around and learned the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and experts from the Dragon Saint Palace had already gone into the Dragon Soul Mountain. </p>
			<p>Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to enter the Dragon Soul Mountain, a group of experts appeared and the leader was actually Domineering Blade Xihu.</p>
			<p>Domineering Blade Xihu was leading several hundred subordinates to enter the Dragon Soul Mountain when he spotted the familiar figure up ahead. A violent shiver ran down his body.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong!” Domineering Blade Xihu blurted out subconsciously, and because he was used to talking loudly, his exclamation was heard by many experts who were also entering the Dragon Soul Mountain.</p>
			<p>In an instant, the atmosphere outside the Dragon Soul Mountain exploded.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong? Is he the same Huang Xiaolong who kidnapped the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?!”</p>
			<p>“Which one is Huang Xiaolong?!!”</p>
			<p>“His Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor has ordered that anyone who finds Huang Xiaolong will be rewarded with ten peak-level Dragon Race’s universe origin spiritual veins! And they can also choose a treasure from the Dragon Emperor’s treasury!” </p>
			<p>After a brief moment of shock and disarray, almost all gazes followed Domineering Blade Xihu’s line of sight and locked onto Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong became the center of attention among these thousands and thousands of experts.𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝒐𝙫𝙚𝓵.𝓬𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong furrowed in dislike. He turned and glanced at the Domineering Blade Xihu. Merely a glance caused Domineering Blade Xihu to plummet from high air.</p>
			<p>Fear was clearly written on Domineering Blade Xihu’s face, and pangs of regret twisted his gut, as he chided himself for his lack of control over his mouth. </p>
			<p>While Domineering Blade Xihu was filled with fear and regret, Huang Xiaolong turned and sped into the Dragon Soul Mountain, disappearing from sight in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<p>Domineering Blade Xihu was stupefied for a second.</p>
			<p>He initially thought that Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked at him to slap him!</p>
			<p>After all, the scene where Huang Xiaolong sent the Treasure Sage Human Emperor crashing into the base of Big River Mountain with one palm strike was still clear in his mind.</p>
			<p>Other experts were too stunned to react after Huang Xiaolong disappeared into the Dragon Soul Mountain, they exchanged glances, and none of them dared to chase after Huang Xiaolong in the end. Quite a few of them were experts over the twenty billion mark like Domineering Blade Xihu.</p>
			<p>Several hundred thousand experts stood silently even after Huang Xiaolong had left, but a while later, when everyone was certain that he had truly left, they were in a furor.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong actually came to Dragon Soul Mountain! What is he doing here? Is he coveting the dragon soul source?” a family’s old ancestor took a wild guess.</p>
			<p>“The dragon soul source belongs to His Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor. How dare he covet it? He is really overestimating himself!”</p>
			<p>“There are numerous Origin Universe experts in the Dragon Soul Mountain, yet Huang Xiaolong has the guts to show up here. He is seeking to die fast!”</p>
			<p>All the experts were talking about Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Before long, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, who had entered the Dragon Soul Mountain earlier than Huang Xiaolong, learned that he had entered the mountain.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Huang Xiaolong is also here?” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor wondered out loud.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong’s got guts. Despite knowing that His Majesty is within the Dragon Soul Mountain, he dares to appear! From what others are saying, he should be here for the dragon soul source!” a Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal stated.</p>
			<p>“I say he’s purely here to die!” Another Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal sneered with disdain.</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor spoke objectively, “He must have a certain level of confidence since he dares to show up here. I must get the dragon soul source this time! Pass my order to obtain Huang Xiaolong’s exact location. After getting the dragon soul source, I will check him out myself.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor!”</p>
			<p>…… </p>
			<p>Upon entering the Dragon Soul Mountain, Huang Xiaolong did not stop anywhere. His dao souls spread out as he moved deeper into the mountain, searching for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>The dragon soul source was located in the deepest part of the mountain. Therefore, if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor wanted to get the dragon soul source, he would be heading in that direction. </p>
			<p>Along the way, Huang Xiaolong encountered more than a few powerful dragon souls. To the general half-step Universe God, these dragon souls were treasures, but to Huang Xiaolong, they were useless.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong did not conceal his aura or movements, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor continuously received reports on his location.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Huang Xiaolong is coming to the deepest part of Dragon Soul Mountain?” Dragon Sage Human Emperor was surprised. “He really came for the Dragon soul source!”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, should this subordinate go and deal with Huang Xiaolong?” the Dragon Saint Palace’s grand marshal inquired.</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor shook his head. “There is no need. It is more important for me to integrate with the dragon soul source at this point. Moreover, even if all of you join hands, you might not be Huang Xiaolong’s match.”</p>
			<p>“Tell the people to continue watching Huang Xiaolong.”</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor continued advancing further with the experts from Dragon Saint Palace, while trying to sense the dragon soul source’s location with a dragon pearl he had refined. The group finally reached a huge cliff wall.</p>
			<p>This enormous cliff wall stretched several hundred thousand miles wide, and from afar, it looked like a barricade that prevented others from crossing and moving forward.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3747: I Heard You’ve Got a Devil Mirror Fragment</p>
			</title>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor stared at the enormous cliff wall before him. Surging dragon qi appeared around him as he shouted towards it, “Ao Shan, stop hiding. This time, I will definitely subjugate you, and have you integrate into me.”</p>
			<p>Ao Shan was the name the dragon soul was born with.</p>
			<p>It was silent for a while after the Dragon Sage Human Emperor finished speaking, but they saw bright light emerging to the surface of the cliff wall after a while. </p>
			<p>A dragon condensed from golden light, and this was the dragon soul source, Ao Shan.</p>
			<p>“Ao Xuan, you think you’re capable of absorbing me?” the Dragon soul source Ao Shan sneered. “After so many years, you’re still dreaming when the sun is out!”</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor wasn’t angered by Ao Shan’s mocking words. “I couldn’t do so in the past, but this time, I have collected materials from the Origin Universe and outside of the Origin Universe that can suppress Dragon Race’s dragon souls. I spent several hundred million years forging a Dragon Soul Bind. With this Dragon Soul Bind, you won’t be able to escape from me!”</p>
			<p>A golden rope flew into the air as soon as he finished speaking. The golden rope wasn’t particularly thick but when the Dragon Sage Human Emperor channeled his dragon energy into it, the golden rope grew twice its size and length, standing vertically between heaven and earth as if it was about to bind the heavens.</p>
			<p>The golden rope exuded a faint but bright glow, and under the scope of the glow, the dragon soul source Ao Shan was pinned on the spot. </p>
			<p>Ao Xuan was genuinely alarmed. </p>
			<p>“The rest of you guard the surroundings, and don’t allow anyone to approach this place,” Dragon Sage Human Emperor ordered the Dragon Saint Palace’s experts.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts respectfully complied and spread out a distance around the area to prohibit others from approaching. </p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor waved his hands in the air as if he was orchestrating the golden rope. The golden rope wriggled in the air and formed a loop that went after the dragon soul Ao Shan. </p>
			<p>Just as the golden loop was reaching the cliff wall, the dragon light condensed by the dragon soul source burst in glaring rays of light that soared to the sky, and the startling dragon qi repelled off the Dragon Soul Bind. </p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor was inwardly startled.𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝙗𝙣𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝙘𝒐𝓶</p>
			<p>This dragon soul has grown stronger again since the last time!</p>
			<p>“Ao Xuan, this Dragon Soul Bind of yours can indeed suppress me, but do you really think you can capture me based on some rope?” dragon soul Ao Shan sneered. “If you’re able to capture me relying on a mere rope, I won’t be called the dragon soul source.”</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor remained calm on the surface. “That’s because you still have not seen the true power of the Dragon Soul Bind!”</p>
			<p>“I will have you witness the true power of this Dragon Soul Bind!” Dragon Sage Human Emperor rose to the sky, standing in the middle of the Dragon Soul Bind. The golden rope coiled around him, and dragon qi from his body surged and spread into an ocean of dragon qi. Glaring lights dominated the sky as countless phantoms of divine dragons flew out from the Dragon Soul Bind.</p>
			<p>A shocking dragon might descend onto the land like a tsunami.</p>
			<p>“This is?!” Dragon soul Ao Shan couldn't help but exclaim in shock and burning anger, “Ao Xuan, in order to forge this Dragon Soul Bind, you killed so many God of Creation Realm dragons, your sins are unforgivable!”</p>
			<p>“Sins are unforgivable?!” Dragon Sage Human Emperor stood in the air with his hands clasped at his back. “Once I successfully comprehend the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, I can breakthrough to a Universe God. At that time, all the universes’ living beings will kneel before me, and I will rule them. Even Yuan Fang won’t be an exception. At that time, who will dare to say I have sinned?” </p>
			<p>As the Dragon Sage Human Emperor spoke, his hands moved, and the numerous divine dragons’ souls formed the Grand Formation of Dragon. The Grand Formation of Dragon locked the immediate space around the dragon soul source Ao Shan. Ao Shan distinctly felt his strength and body being greatly suppressed, reducing his agility.</p>
			<p>Dragon Sage Human Emperor blurred in a flicker and appeared above the dragon soul source with the Dragon Spear in his hand thrusting downward.</p>
			<p>Dragon soul source Ao Shan struck out with his claw in panic.</p>
			<p>In the past, his strike could easily scatter the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s spear qi, but this time around, the spear qi pierced through his attack and landed on his palm.</p>
			<p>“Ao Xuan, you’re relying on the Dragon Soul Bind to suppress me, but you yourself have no ability!” the dragon soul source roared. </p>
			<p>“A win is a win. To me, the process is not important,” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor stated nonchalantly.</p>
			<p>“You’re right. A win is a win, and the process is not important,” right at this time, a voice repeated the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s words, applauding in agreement.</p>
			<p>Both the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source were startled by the unexpected voice.</p>
			<p>“Who is it?!” Dragon Saint Palace’s experts barked curtly from the four directions.</p>
			<p>A figure approached leisurely from the horizon. He was a young man, and he reached the enormous cliff wall in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>“Stop right there!”</p>
			<p>A Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal shouted, trying to stop the intruder in his tracks, but no one saw what Huang Xiaolong did, and in the next second, that marshal was knocked into the air, and he fell into a dirt puddle not far away.</p>
			<p>The air seemed to solidify.</p>
			<p>That Dragon Saint Palace marshall was a supreme expert with 23.1 billion mark battle strength.</p>
			<p>A thought flashed in the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s mind as he stared at the uninvited visitor. “Are you Huang Xiaolong?”</p>
			<p>Other Dragon Saint Palace experts were shocked to hear that.</p>
			<p>Only the dragon soul source Ao Shan seemed baffled as he had never heard of Huang Xiaolong’s name.</p>
			<p>That’s right, the young man was Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong continued to walk forward, bypassing the Dragon Saint Palace’s experts and stood meters from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. “Yes, I am Huang Xiaolong.”</p>
			<p>He glanced at the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s Dragon Soul Bind and the dragon soul source.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor frowned slightly at Huang Xiaolong’s abrupt appearance as he was on the verge of successfully capturing the dragon soul source with the Dragon Soul Bind. Who knew the most crucial moment would be interrupted by Huang Xiaolong?</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong easily defeated the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, proving that he was no walkover, and his strength was probably comparable to the second-ranked Human Emperor, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor. It would be troublesome if Huang Xiaolong joined hands with the dragon soul source. </p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you’re also here for the dragon soul force?” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor asked in a sullen tone. “How about this? We can cooperate to capture this dragon soul source and divide it between the two of us. I will take eighty percent and you can take twenty.”</p>
			<p>But Huang Xiaolong shook his head and stated, “I didn’t come for the dragon soul source.”</p>
			<p>Didn’t come for the dragon soul source?</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor and Dragon Saint Palace’s experts had not expected that. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong then said to the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, “I heard that you’ve got a piece of devil mirror fragment from the Devil Mirror Palace.”</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face sank, and he laughed without mirth in his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, are you telling me that you’ve come to the Dragon Soul Mountain for my fragment of devil mirror?”</p>
			<p>As he spoke, his momentum rose dangerously and a suffocating dragon might rush towards Huang Xiaolong. He had not settled the account with Xiaolong for kidnapping the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, yet Huang Xiaolong had the audacity to covet the devil mirror fragment from him.</p>
			<p>“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong ignored the rising momentum from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and went on casually, “Hand over the mirror fragment if you don’t wish to end up like the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, and don’t force me to take it.”</p>
			<p>“Insolent!”</p>
			<p>The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts were enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s words, and all of them lunged towards him. But, all of them were sent flying with a wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand even before they got close, and they crashed to the ground in various directions.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3748: Raining Punches on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor</p>
			</title>
			<p>These Dragon Saint Palace experts coughed up blood as they crashed to the ground. </p>
			<p>Both the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source were astonished. The Dragon Sage Human Emperor could barely accept it. After all, he knew Huang Xiaolong took away the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, whereas the dragon soul source was completely ignorant. Therefore, he received a bigger shock watching Huang Xiaolong send several hundreds of Dragon Saint Palace experts flying with a wave of his hand.</p>
			<p>Among these several hundreds of Dragon Saint Palace experts, there were existences with twenty-one billion marks battle strength.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare those Dragon Saint Palace experts a second glance and further shortened the distance between him and the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. “I don’t like to repeat myself, so hand over the devil mirror fragment.”</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face turned unsightly as he was the human race’s strongest cultivator!</p>
			<p>The second strongest person in the entire Origin Universe!</p>
			<p>Since when did someone dare to talk to him so?!</p>
			<p>“Dao Brother Huang Xiaolong, we can join hands to suppress the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the devil mirror fragment on him will go to you,” the dragon soul source Ao Shan suddenly interjected.</p>
			<p>After witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s strength, the dragon soul source was ecstatic.  </p>
			<p>“Join hands?” Huang Xiaolong glanced at the dragon soul source from the corner of his eye and asked, “Who told you that I would agree to join hands with you?”</p>
			<p>The dragon soul source was rendered awkward by Huang Xiaolong’s directness, and anger and humiliation burned in his chest.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor suddenly appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, and he directly stabbed the Dragon Spear towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>There was only a small distance between the two. On top of that, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor attacked suddenly. Hence the Dragon Spear was mere inches from penetrating Huang Xiaolong’s back.</p>
			<p>Right at this time, thirteen spheres of light appeared around Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Zheng!</p>
			<p>The Dragon Spear in his hand stabbed into one of the thirteen spheres.</p>
			<p>While the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was stunned that his sneak attack failed, he was knocked back by the repelling power from the thirteen light spheres.</p>
			<p>The dragon soul source was just as shocked as the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Not only Huang Xiaolong was fine after taking a blow from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was sent staggering backward instead!</p>
			<p>Probably the Origin Universe’s number one expert also wouldn’t be able to do this, right?</p>
			<p>The dragon soul source looked at the thirteen spheres around Huang Xiaolong that were exactly the mini versions of the Thirteen Universes with each one containing supreme universe esoterics and laws.</p>
			<p>“These are?!” The Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder as he fixed his icy gaze on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, “Originally, I merely wanted you to hand out the devil mirror fragment, but unfortunately, you forced me to act.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s Universe Transformation Art had already reached great perfection state for he had thoroughly comprehended the nameless devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws.</p>
			<p>It was no exaggeration to say that with Huang Xiaolong’s current battle strength, even if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source joined hands against him, they were no match against Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>After saying that, Huang Xiaolong stepped towards the Dragon Sage Human Emperor at a slow pace, however, every step he took, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s heart tightened a notch.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong got closer, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor felt suffocated.</p>
			<p>This was the kind of feeling he got when in awe while looking at an indomitable great mountain. No, more accurately, Huang Xiaolong was an avatar of the Universe’s heaven and earth, whereas he was merely a lowly existence in the universe, the same like many others.</p>
			<p>How is this possible?</p>
			<p>At this moment, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s heart actually gave birth to fear. </p>
			<p>Even when facing Yuan Fang, he did not give birth to apprehension, much less fear. But now, he felt genuine fear towards a human race’s junior.𝓯𝓻𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝓫𝓷𝓸𝒗𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝓶</p>
			<p>Amidst his fear, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor let out a roar to the sky, and soundwaves of a dragon’s roar shook the air. With a wave of his hand, he sent the Dragon Soul Bind towards Huang Xiaolong while yelling at the dragon soul source, “Ao Shan, we’ll join hands and deal with him. If I lose here, you won’t fare much better because Huang Xiaolong definitely won’t let you off!”</p>
			<p>Ao Shan was caught off guard by the proposal.</p>
			<p>But in the next second, he snickered, “Even if I won’t fare well, I would rather watch you being abused to death!”</p>
			<p>A while ago, he was nearly captured by the Dragon Sage Human Emperor to be absorbed. As forgiving as he might be, it hadn’t reached the point where he would cooperate with the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor was infuriated upon hearing that.</p>
			<p>The thirteen light spheres around Huang Xiaolong flew up and rammed against the Dragon Soul Bind. With the thirteen spheres circling around, the Dragon Soul Bind’s thousands of divine dragons were pulverized and scattered away.</p>
			<p>The golden rope that was connected from head to tail to form a circle was cut into several sections, and it scattered all over.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor paled visibly.</p>
			<p>The Dragon Soul Bind was something he had put a lot of effort and time in, as well as the effort of many experts in the Dragon Saint Palace, but it got cut into pieces just like that!</p>
			<p>While the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was in the cusp of panic, Huang Xiaolong punched out with his fist.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong punched out, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor had a fleeting feeling that there were thirteen universes slamming towards him.</p>
			<p>He didn’t have time to think too much, and he hollered as he gathered every shred of cosmos energy in his body. Glaring light burst out from his palms and shot straight at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>It was obvious that the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was desperate.</p>
			<p>But it was futile. As Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed, the Dragon Spear broke into several sections, and even the dragon head handle of the spear shattered. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s fist force finally landed on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. </p>
			<p>The Dragon Sage Human Emperor tumbled in the air like a broken kite to the horizon. </p>
			<p>A long time later, someone reacted.</p>
			<p>“Your Highness Dragon Sage Human Emperor!”</p>
			<p>The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts shouted, their voices filled with despair.</p>
			<p>In a single step, Huang Xiaolong arrived where the Dragon Sage Human Emperor fell. His punch had broken several of the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s ribs, causing his chest to cave in, and the dragon qi around him dissipated, revealing his bloody and gravely wounded body.</p>
			<p>This was the power of Huang Xiaolong’s thirteen universes. </p>
			<p>Horror was written all over the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>A force dragged the Dragon Sage Human Emperor off the ground. Huang Xiaolong sealed the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s strength, and returned to the previous spot in a flicker.</p>
			<p>……</p>
			<p>Before long, the news spread about Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the disappearance of the experts of Dragon Saint Palace.</p>
			<p>“It is said that Huang Xiaolong tried to snatch the dragon soul source from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the Dragon Sage Human Emperor killed Huang Xiaolong. He then got the dragon soul source and entered seclusion!” said a family’s old ancestor.</p>
			<p>“Didn’t I say it earlier, that Huang Xiaolong is practically seeking death to try to snatch the dragon soul source from His Majesty!”</p>
			<p>For a period of time, rumors flew about.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t know about the rumors flying outside. At this time, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged in the depths of Dragon Soul Mountain, and there was a devil mirror fragment suspended in front of him. This was the piece of devil mirror fragment the Dragon Sage Human Emperor obtained from the Devil Mirror Palace.</p>
			<p>This piece of devil mirror fragment was made of the same material as Huang Xiaolong’s nameless devil mirror. His full attention was on the piece of devil mirror fragment, and from the mirror surface, he could see flashes of images like what he saw in the nameless devil mirror in the beginning. However, the images on this devil mirror fragment were incomplete.</p>
			<p>Sitting there, Huang Xiaolong was as still as he could be, comprehending the devil mirror fragment. In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of years went by, stopping only when it was almost time for the Devil Mirror Palace to open.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3749: Went To the Front?</p>
			</title>
			<p>“Golden Gorge, Devil Mirror Palace!” Huang Xiaolong put away the devil mirror fragment and disappeared at the edge of the horizon in a streak of light.</p>
			<p>The dragon soul source Ao Shan looked in the direction Huang Xiaolong left with a complicated gaze, muttering under his breath, “Perhaps, not too long from now, the Fourteen Universes’ true lord will appear!”𝑓𝓇ℯℯ𝓌ℯ𝑏𝑛𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮</p>
			<p>Counting the Origin Universe and the Thirteen Universes, there were fourteen universes in all. </p>
			<p>From the time when the fourteen universes were born, there had never been one true sovereign lord.</p>
			<p>But the dragon soul source had a feeling that not too far in the future, the fourteen universes’ true sovereign lord would appear.</p>
			<p>While Huang Xiaolong was rushing to the Golden Gorge, the many Emperors of Origin Universe were also making haste to the same destination.</p>
			<p>The devil mirror inside the Devil Mirror Palace held the secret to their breakthrough into Universe God Realm. Who wouldn’t be tempted?</p>
			<p>Not to mention, inside the Devil Mirror Palace were countless treasures, many top-level techniques, peak-level origin universe spiritual veins, guardian treasures, and rare treasures like Universe Source Stones! Some of the top-level cultivation techniques were left behind by experts. </p>
			<p>The Devil Mirror Palace had appeared many times, and every time it appeared, scuffles and conflicts between experts who rushed inside were inevitable, as well as killings. Thus, the top-level cultivation techniques and treasures of these people remained inside the Devil Mirror Palace. </p>
			<p>Of course, there were many treasures that existed since the beginning together with the Devil Mirror Palace, such as peak-grade origin universe spiritual veins, guardian treasures, and Universe Source Stones. </p>
			<p>In the Thirteen Universes, a treasure like the Universe Source Stone had only appeared twice! One was obtained by the Universe First Race, and Huang Xiaolong obtained the second stone not long ago at the White Deer Cave. Universe Source Stones were rarer than rare. However, every time the Devil Mirror Palace appeared, there would be experts who obtained Universe Source Stones within.</p>
			<p>The Golden Gorge was located in a vast desert, and the desert was within the territory of the third-ranked strongest cultivator in the Origin Universe, the Lord of Ghost Desert.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong reached the Golden Gorge a year later, the area was already crowded with experts. </p>
			<p>In the four directions of the Golden Gorge were experts from various celestial empires’ families, and all of them were cultivators of God of Creation Realm. At a rough glance, there were at least several million people.</p>
			<p>There were layers of restrictions around the Devil Mirror Palace, even in the outermost area. Only God of Creation Realm experts could enter, thus only experts of God of Creation Realm and above gathered here.</p>
			<p>The Golden Gorge stretched miles across the desert, just like a gaping abyss across the barren desert viewed from above. Throughout the year, the Golden Gorge was filled with a kind of golden fog, and that was where the Golden Gorge got its name.</p>
			<p>No one knew exactly how deep the Golden Gorge was. The Lord of Ghost Desert had once descended down the Golden Gorge, but even after several thousand years, he still did not reach the bottom of the gorge and had to return to the surface.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the further down he went, there was a devouring force coming from below.</p>
			<p>Therefore, no one had ever reached the bottom of Golden Gorge.</p>
			<p>Some people claimed the bottom of the Golden Gorge was the deepest part of the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>However, this remained a myth with no way of proving its authenticity until someone successfully reached the gorge’s bottom and came back out.</p>
			<p>At the time Huang Xiaolong arrived, he took a quick look around, then headed straight to the center of the Golden Gorge because every time the Devil Mirror Palace had appeared in the past, it was always at the center of the gorge.</p>
			<p>However, the Golden Gorge’s one hundred thousand miles radius area had been blocked off by Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, and the rest of the human race’s ten Emperors. Other races’ old ancestors and patriarchs were unable to get close at all.</p>
			<p>Experts that broke the twenty billion mark like Old Granny Void and Domineering Blade Xihu were all waiting outside of the one hundred thousand miles radius, and no one dared to take one step across the line.</p>
			<p>Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to enter the Golden Gorge’s center area, a half-step Universe God Realm expert breaking ten billion marks in battle strength, saw an unknown human race youngster bypass him. His face sank. “Brat, scram to the back, or else…” </p>
			<p>But before he could finish the rest of his sentence, he was overwhelmed by the monstrous momentum coming from Huang Xiaolong’s body. The ten billion mark expert was startled, and just as he thought of dodging, it was already too late. In a split second, he was struck by the force from Huang Xiaolong’s body and sent flying. </p>
			<p>This sight shocked the surrounding experts who noticed the commotion there. </p>
			<p>The expert Huang Xiaolong sent flying ended up with severe injuries, and he was quite famous in the Origin Universe. Many experts recognized him, and because of that many experts were shocked. </p>
			<p>“Who is this youngster?!”</p>
			<p>“Could he be one of the Human Emperors’ disciples or juniors?” </p>
			<p>Many experts had the same guess.</p>
			<p>Whilst these guesses were shared through low whispers, someone in the crowd exclaimed, “Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>The noisy environment suddenly died abruptly.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong? Which Huang Xiaolong?” an old ancestor asked in confusion.</p>
			<p> ‘He’s the one who kidnapped His Majesty Treasure Sage Human Emperor, that Huang Xiaolong!” The person who recognized Huang Xiaolong blurted out in excitement. This family patriarch happened to be at the Big River Mountain at that time. </p>
			<p>The scene exploded upon hearing the old ancestor’s explanation.</p>
			<p>“What?! It’s him?! That human race youngster is Huang Xiaolong! Aren’t they saying that he was killed by the Dragon Sage Human Emperor for trying to snatch the dragon soul source?”</p>
			<p>“Did His Majesty the Dragon Sage Human Emperor spare him? Or did he escape by a stroke of luck?” </p>
			<p>These experts’ astonished and bewildered gazes followed Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The news of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival traveled fast, from one person to a hundred, and before long, almost everyone at the Golden Gorge had heard about it.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Huang Xiaolong,” Yuan Fang who was waiting at the frontmost area in the center of the Golden Gorge made a small gasp of surprise.</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert remained expressionless.</p>
			<p>Eight Human Emperors looked towards the outer edge of the barricaded area, and each had a different expression on their face.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty Buddha Sage Human Emperor, that Huang Xiaolong… Should we?” one of the Buddha Saint Palace’s experts couldn’t help but ask, referring to whether they should capture Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Other Human Emperors also looked to the Buddha Sage Human Emperor for his decision. </p>
			<p>“The Devil Mirror Palace will appear in half an hour. It won’t be too late to capture Huang Xiaolong once we’re inside,” said the Buddha Sage Human Emperor.</p>
			<p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
			<p>After Huang Xiaolong got the annoying expert out of his sight, he continued towards the center area. This time, no one dared to stop him anymore. In fact, the crowd separated and opened a wide berth for him to pass through.</p>
			<p>Even experts breaking the twenty-billion mark like Old Granny Void and Domineering Blade Xihu dared not block Huang Xiaolong’s path.</p>
			<p>Soon, Huang Xiaolong reached the edge of the center area, and before everyone’s eyes, he stepped into the center area and continued forward until he was behind the eight Human Emperors’ camp.</p>
			<p>The eight Human Emperors’ cold gazes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, and the overwhelming momentum from their bodies came crashing down on him.</p>
			<p>All eyes were on Huang Xiaolong and the eight Human Emperors. </p>
			<p>“Say, do you guys think that Huang Xiaolong would dare to bypass the eight Human Emperors and stand in front of them?” Domineering Blade Xihu asked in a hushed whisper.</p>
			<p>“Probably not, right?” The Gold Devouring Supreme shook his head. After all, the ones in Huang Xiaolong’s path were eight of the human race’s Human Emperors!</p>
			<p>The remaining eight Human Emperors were in full attendance!</p>

				<p>Chapter 3750: Surpass Yuan Fang</p>
			</title>
			<p>The crowd thought that if there was only one Human Emperor present, Huang Xiaolong would have probably dared to get ahead of him, but there were eight Human Emperors gathered, and the magnitude was completely different. </p>
			<p>If the human race’s eight Human Emperors join hands, even an expert like the Lord of Ghost Desert would ashen.</p>
			<p>A twenty-billion-mark expert snickered harshly when he saw Huang Xiaolong suddenly stop. “Looks like even Huang Xiaolong has to cower in front of the eight Human Emperors.” </p>
			<p>Other experts snickered as if that would vent the anger in their hearts.</p>
			<p>Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong lifted his foot and continued onward, rendering the crowd dumbfounded.</p>
			<p>Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s eldest disciple rebuked Huang Xiaolong coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, if you dare to take another step forward, my master and other Majesties Human Emperors will absolutely kill you!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong took a nonchalant glance at the Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s disciple. Just one glance from him knocked the disciple into the air for no apparent reason.</p>
			<p>The crowd of experts in the Golden Gorge was stupefied.</p>
			<p>The Buddha Sage Human Emperor had not expected Huang Xiaolong to suddenly attack. After the initial split second of shock, his face sank, and he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as he said to the other seven Human Emperors, “Brothers, the Devil Mirror Palace is about to appear. The eight of us should join hands and swiftly deal with Huang Xiaolong. What do you think?” </p>
			<p>The third-ranked Horned Sage Human Emperor nodded in agreement. “Brother Buddha Sage’s intention is exactly my meaning.”</p>
			<p>Seeing that the Horned Sage Human Emperor agreed, the remaining six Human Emperors also nodded.</p>
			<p>Immediately, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor, Horned Sage Human Emperor, and the rest of the eight Human Emperors’ momentum soared as they released their full force.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>Influenced by the eight Human Emperors’ momentums, the sky darkened, and the wind howled making sand swirl into a sandstorm.</p>
			<p>Sensing the overwhelming momentums coming from the eight Human Emperors, everyone present paled and retreated as if they could not back away fast enough. Even the Lord of Ghost Desert looked solemn. </p>
			<p>“Kill!”</p>
			<p>When the eight Human Emperors circulated their energy to the limit, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor opened his mouth and thundered, and his voice shook heaven and earth.</p>
			<p>Whilst everyone was shocked, the eight Human Emperors attacked at the same time.</p>
			<p>All eight Human Emperors used their most powerful guardian treasures to attack Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s guardian treasure was an alms bowl!</p>
			<p>Whereas the Horned Sage Human Emperor’s guardian treasure was a long curved horn that didn’t look like metal or non-metal material. The surface of the curved horn was densely covered with runes.</p>
			<p>Some of the other six Human Emperors used blades, swords, and even a giant axe.</p>
			<p>There were also strong and weak guardian treasures, and the eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures were naturally top-tier powerful guardian treasures.</p>
			<p>With eight powerful guardian treasures infused with eight Human Emperors’ power, the dazzling rays blinded everyone and lit up the entire desert gorge, and even the outside area.𝓯𝒓𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝒃𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝙢</p>
			<p>The weaker God of Creation Realm experts felt pain in their eyes the moment they laid eyes on the light.</p>
			<p>The eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong at lightning speed.</p>
			<p>There was no ripple of panic on Huang Xiaolong’s face as a small golden boat appeared in his hand. The small golden boat took on the eight guardian treasures’ attacks as it expanded into a million zhang in length.</p>
			<p>Rumble!</p>
			<p>The giant golden boat collided with the eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures one by one.</p>
			<p>Consecutive blasts shook the sky.</p>
			<p>To Old Granny Void and the others’ horror, the eight Human Emperors’s guardian treasures were knocked away.</p>
			<p>When the Buddha Sage Human Emperor saw the golden boat, he was shocked to his soul, “Universe treasure!”</p>
			<p>In the next second, the golden boat slammed into the eight Human Emperors, and the overwhelming destructive energy caused their faces to turn deathly pale. No one dared to hide their trump cards anymore and tried to parry the Universe Boat the best they could.</p>
			<p>Boom!</p>
			<p>Almost at the same time, the Universe Boat slammed into the eight Human Emperors.</p>
			<p>Another wave of blasts thundered across the sky, shaking the land.</p>
			<p>Some families’ old ancestors’ eardrums bursts due to the collision impact, and many more suffered concussions. </p>
			<p>All of the eight Human Emperors possessed battle strength above the twenty billion mark, especially the Buddha Sage Human Emperor who had crossed the twenty-nine billion mark. One could imagine how terrifying the combined strengths of these eight Human Emperors were.</p>
			<p>Even the Lord of Ghost Desert looked extremely solemn.</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat was finally stopped right in front of the eight Human Emperors’ faces with their joined effort.</p>
			<p>But the Lord of Ghost Desert, Old Granny Void, and the others’ eyes widened as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. Although the Universe Boat was stopped in its tracks by the eight Human Emperors, Huang Xiaolong had been standing in the same spot from the beginning, without moving an inch!</p>
			<p>With one arm, Huang Xiaolong steadied the Universe Boat’s other side! </p>
			<p>In other words, Huang Xiaolong merely used one hand to withstand the eight Human Emperors’ combined attacks without moving an inch.</p>
			<p>Even Yuan Fang who had been watching everything with a blase expression couldn’t hide the shock in his eyes.</p>
			<p>The eight Human Emperors’ eyes protruded in shock, staring at Huang Xiaolong on the other side of the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p>Before the crowd recovered, Huang Xiaolong’s palm emitted brilliant rays as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art, and robust cosmos energy of 29.9 billion mark roared out.</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat shone glaringly as a startling energy burst out from it, hitting the eight Human Emperors. The eight Human Emperors were alarmed and moved to dodge but their action was still a beat too slow, b-b-oom!</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat quivered and shook off the eight Human Emperors, and Huang Xiaolong went on to push the Universe Boat forward. </p>
			<p>The eight Human Emperors got the air knocked out of them.</p>
			<p>“Pu!”</p>
			<p>Eight figures crashed into the gorge like meteors, with blood spurting out from their mouths.</p>
			<p>The eight Human Emperors soon disappeared into the gorge, and they were obscured from view by the golden fog. </p>
			<p>“What?!” The Lord of Ghost Desert as well as the present family’s old ancestors and patriarchs shrieked.</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang was genuinely shocked for the first time in his life.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he retrieved the Universe Boat, and continued onward towards the Lord of Ghost Desert.</p>
			<p>Seeing Huang Xiaolong approach, apprehension flitted across the Lord of Ghost Desert’s pupils. His face darkened as he pondered if he should give way to Huang Xiaolong, but his decision was made swiftly as he stepped to the side.</p>
			<p>When Huang Xiaolong passed by the Lord of Ghost Desert, he didn’t even give the Lord of Ghost Desert a direct gaze.</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert’s nerve twitched at being treated as invisible. </p>
			<p>When Yuan Fang saw Huang Xiaolong come at him, he was stunned for a second. It seemed like Huang Xiaolong didn’t only want to stand in front of the Lord of Ghost Desert, but he wanted to bypass him as well. </p>
			<p>Sharp golden light burst in Yuan Fang’s eyes.</p>
			<p>All other experts held their breaths, watching Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Fang.</p>
			<p>Their hearts twisted in nervous tension and faint anticipation.</p>
			<p>There was no expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he got closer to Yuan Fang with each step he took, and soon, there was merely ten meters distance between them. Then it was nine meters, eight meters…</p>
			<p>Four meters!</p>
			<p>Three meters!</p>
			<p>When he was one meter away from Yuan Fang, Yuan Fang suddenly took a step to the left, rendering everyone dumbfounded. Huang Xiaolong walked past the spot Yuan Fang was standing earlier, and stood in the first spot in the Golden Gorge’s center area.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stood one hundred meters in front of Yuan Fang with his hands clasped behind his back.</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang stared sullenly at Huang Xiaolong’s back.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3751: The Devil Mirror Palace Appears</p>
			</title>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stood nonchalantly as if he did not feel the gloomy gaze piercing his back, exposing his back to Yuan Fang without any vigilance.</p>
			<p>All the present God of Creation Realm experts looked at Huang Xiaolong with complicated gazes. They were shaken, baffled, filled with disbelief and other tumultuous emotions. </p>
			<p>Yuan Fang’s hands were tightly clenched into fists, quietly, as killing intent gathered in his chest, but soon, he unclenched his hands finally.</p>
			<p>He did not attack in the end. </p>
			<p>While an array of expressions flickered across the crowd, several figures flew out from the Golden Gorge. These were the eight Human Emperors smashed into the Golden Gorge. It could be seen that the armors on their bodies were broken, and it looked like every part of their bodies was bleeding. </p>
			<p>Gasps of shock and hiss of breaths could be heard from the crowd.</p>
			<p>These were the human race’s eight Human Emperors!</p>
			<p>Moreover, there was the Buddha Sage Human Emperor with more than twenty-nine billion mark battle strength!</p>
			<p>Buddha Sage Human Emperor and the other seven Human Emperors glared furiously at Huang Xiaolong, but this time around, their eyes were strained with apprehension and no one dared to attack Huang Xiaolong anymore. </p>
			<p>“You’re not a native of the Origin Universe!” the Buddha Sage Human Emperor suddenly stated in a moment of fury. </p>
			<p>“What? He’s not a native of our Origin Universe?!” </p>
			<p>The several million God of Creation experts exploded in a furor.</p>
			<p>Before the Buddha Sage Human Emperor pointed that out, this thought had never occurred to anyone.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong responded simply, “Correct, I’m not a native of Origin Universe.”</p>
			<p>It was unnecessary to conceal this point.𝒇𝒓𝙚𝙚𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝒐𝙫𝙚𝓵.𝓬𝒐𝒎</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong knew the matter would be exposed when he used the Universe Boat.</p>
			<p>The Origin Universe only had one universe treasure, but it wasn’t the Universe Boat. Hence, it wasn’t hard to guess that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a native of the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>“You’re really not from our Origin Universe?!” the Horned Sage Human Emperor was incensed. “Listen up all Origin Universe’s experts, join hands, and eliminate Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>Join hands and eliminate this Huang Xiaolong!</p>
			<p>The immediate reaction was baffled glances all around, and no one took a step forward.</p>
			<p>The Horned Sage Human Emperor did not expect this less-than-lukewarm reaction. He looked around and his gaze stopped on the Lord of Ghost Desert, but the Lord of Ghost Desert looked straight at a certain point of the Golden Gorge as if he did not sense the Horned Sage Human Emperor’s gaze, and the golden fog in that area was different from others.</p>
			<p>The Horned Sage Human Emperor then looked at Yuan Fang. Yuna Fang’s face was extremely gloomy. Even so, he did not respond to the Horned Sage Human Emperor’s call.</p>
			<p>The Horned Sage Human Emperor felt extremely embarrassed.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on the Horned Sage Human Emperor. “If you continue to jump in front of me, I won’t mind exerting some force to burst you before the Devil Mirror Palace appears.” </p>
			<p>The Horned Sage Human Emperor choked over Huang Xiaolong’s threat, and his face turned red and green from suffocated fury, but despite that, he quieted down.</p>
			<p>Buddha Sage Human Emperor returned to his initial spots feeling his face burn under the strange gazes falling on him from various experts.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at the roiling golden fog in the center area, and his tepid voice rang, “Black Nether King, Old Man Fortune, since both of you are here, why bother hiding like sewer rats?”</p>
			<p>Although Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune hid themselves well, their auras fluctuated when Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Boat to smash the eight Human Emperors into the Golden Gorge.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s perplexing words baffled Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, the eight Human Emperors, and the others.</p>
			<p>Who’s Black Nether King? Old Man Fortune?</p>
			<p>People Huang Xiaolong spoke with specifically wouldn’t be simple, but they had never heard anyone with these names in the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>Neither Black Nether King nor Old Man Fortune appeared after Huang Xiaolong’s words. Huang Xiaolong did not pursue the matter because with his current strength, he was not afraid of whatever schemes those two had. </p>
			<p>Half an hour soon passed.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, the golden fog around the Golden Gorge churned like angry waves as rays of auspicious light shone from the depths of the gorge to the sky.</p>
			<p>“It’s the Devil Mirror Palace, the Devil Mirror Palace is coming out!” an expert exclaimed in joy. </p>
			<p>This was a sign the Devil Mirror Palace was about to appear. </p>
			<p>Yuan Fang, the Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others’ eyes lit up, and burning gazes were affixed to the center of the gorge.</p>
			<p>Under these anticipative gazes, the Devil Mirror Palace did not disappoint as it rose slowly. Waves of energy swept in the four directions, and the weaker God of Creation Realm experts were sent tumbling into the air as they failed to keep their footing.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stood stable as a mountain where he was, letting the energy waves rush past him as the corners of his robe fluttered loudly.</p>
			<p>Finally, the entire Devil Mirror Palace was in full view as it emerged out from the gorge into high air.</p>
			<p>Merely the radius of Devil Mirror Palace was several million miles, and there were various kinds of diagrams depicted all over the surface, as well as runes. But these diagrams were profound, just like the runes, ethereal and difficult to grasp, much less see through their profundity. </p>
			<p>In one stride, Huang Xiaolong arrived before the Devil Mirror Palace’s great door that was still closed at this point.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong pressed his palm against the door, and the tightly shut door emitted a bright light, followed by rumbling noises as the door slowly opened.</p>
			<p>In a flash, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared into the Devil Mirror Palace.</p>
			<p>The Devil Mirror Palace was divided into an inner and an outer hall. However, there were numerous overlapping dimensions between the two halls, as well as restrictions. To reach the inner hall, Huang Xiaolong has to cross the outer hall’s many layers of restrictions and dimensions.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking, only those with twenty-seven billion mark battle strength could safely pass through the layers of restrictions and dimensions in the outer hall. Even existences like Old Granny Void, and Domineering Blade Xihu could only circulate around the outer hall.</p>
			<p>After Huang Xiaolong entered the Devil Mirror Palace, he did not pause for a second. He took out the Universe Boat and drove it towards the inner hall at full speed. He needed to enter the inner hall before Black Nether King, Old Man Fortune, Yuan Fang, and the others.</p>
			<p>He had thoroughly comprehended the nameless devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws. Along with that, counting the fragment devil mirror in his hand, if he moved faster than Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, and Old Man Fortune in entering the inner hall, he was confident to take away the Origin Universe’s devil mirror! </p>
			<p>Hence, Huang Xiaolong was pushing the Universe Boat’s speed to the limit. On the way, the Universe Boat directly flew past the layers of restrictions and dimensions without stopping for a second.</p>
			<p>While Huang Xiaolong was speeding towards the inner hall, several people were doing the same thing. One of them was a pitch-black light, and another was a bright golden light, both moving at a rapid speed that was no worse than Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>The bright golden light was Yuan Fang. Yuan Fang was shocked when he saw the black light with speed that rivaled his. Who is this?</p>
			<p>Other than Huang Xiaolong, there was another person with strength no less than him!</p>
			<p>Right behind Yuan Fang and Black Nether King was an azure figure that was right on their heels, and he was faster than the Lord of Ghost Desert.</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others were astonished and alarmed seeing the people enshrouded in black and azure light.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong spotted many rare treasures as he sped towards the inner hall that was comparable to white flower spiritual herb inside the White Deer Cave. There were also peak-level origin universe spiritual veins. However, Huang Xiaolong treated all these as nonexistent. He continued to speed inside. Even so, it took Huang Xiaolong several years to reach the Devil Mirror Palace’s inner hall.</p>
			<p>Later on, Huang Xiaolong approached the center of the inner hall.</p>
			<p>A month later, Huang Xiaolong saw a huge Taiji symbol, and on it, was a pentagon-shaped mirror. The mirror was spinning slowly, exuding a faint halo, and it was just like Huang Xiaolong’s nameless devil mirror, except for its bigger size.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air to suppress his excitement.</p>

				<p>Chapter 3752: God of the Universe (Finale I)</p>
			</title>
			<p>Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong summoned the nameless devil mirror. The moment his nameless devil mirror flew out and came near to the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, it emitted the same light as if it was a resonance, a signal, a reunion of a family.</p>
			<p>As expected!</p>
			<p>This sight further proved Huang Xiaolong’s conjecture.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated and circulated the Universe Transformation Art to control the nameless devil mirror to assimilate with the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror. Time was crucial at the moment. The Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, and the others would reach the inner hall in a few days. Therefore, this was the best and fastest method Huang Xiaolong could think of to take away the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror. As long as he could take it away, he could take his time to comprehend the esoterics and laws within.</p>
			<p>Supported by Huang Xiaolong’s Universe Transformation Art, the nameless devil mirror emitted dazzling rays of light, and these rays fell on the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror-like sea waves, entering the big devil mirror. The Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror did not reject the nameless devil mirror’s rays of light, absorbing all of them.</p>
			<p>Seeing things go smoothly, Huang Xiaolong breathed in relief.</p>
			<p>As long as the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror did not reject his nameless devil mirror’s energy, then it significantly increased the chances of assimilating the two mirrors.</p>
			<p>Even so, Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to relax even for a moment, and he was fully focused on the assimilation speed and progress between the mirrors.</p>
			<p>A day passed. </p>
			<p>There didn’t seem to be any changes to the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, just like a bottomless abyss that continued to devour his nameless devil mirror’s energy and light. Huang Xiaolong could feel the Devil Mirror Palace attempting to swallow his nameless devil mirror into itself!</p>
			<p>Two days went by.</p>
			<p>There still weren't any visible changes in the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror.</p>
			<p>Soon, the third day passed.</p>
			<p>Finally, the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror emitted a different light that tried to stop the nameless devil mirror’s light and energy from penetrating into it further. Huang Xiaolong frowned when he noticed this. If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to take away the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror even if another three days passed. By that time, the Black Nether King and the others would have reached the inner hall.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong took out the devil mirror fragment to test a new idea.</p>
			<p>Despite spending almost a hundred thousand years comprehending the devil mirror fragment, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t say he had thoroughly comprehended its contents. Hence, he didn’t plan to take it out originally.</p>
			<p>The devil mirror fragment immediately floated towards the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror. The Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror hummed in protest, and emitted a burst of blinding light, startling Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>All of a sudden, a powerful suction force came from the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror and it devoured Huang Xiaolong’s devil mirror fragment in the blink of an eye!</p>
			<p>Watching the devil mirror fragment being swallowed by the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror palace, Huang Xiaolong froze on the spot. He was utterly blindsided. As Huang Xiaolong tried to sense the situation, the devil mirror fragment was indeed swallowed by the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror!</p>
			<p>The shock receded quickly, and Huang Xiaolong calmed down. Although he had not thoroughly comprehended the devil mirror fragment, there was his soul mark on that piece of devil mirror fragment. In that case, he would attack both internally and externally. While the nameless devil mirror assimilated with the Devil Mirror Palace from outside, he could use his soul mark on the devil mirror fragment to attack the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror on the inside!</p>
			<p>Having figured out his action plan, Huang Xiaolong executed his plan. As he estimated, the result was better than he had expected. In a short half an hour, the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror’s resistance was largely reduced.</p>
			<p>Half a day later, the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror had almost lost all power to resist!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was delighted and accelerated the process.</p>
			<p>Another day passed, and the light coming off the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror had become gentle. </p>
			<p>At this rate, in a few hours, Huang Xiaolong would be able to fully assimilate the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror.</p>
			<p>Even so, Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to relax.</p>
			<p>Another half a day went by.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong paid close attention to the changes in the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, and it had reached the most crucial stage of assimilation, but he already detected that the Black Nether King and Yuan Fang were rapidly closing in on him.</p>
			<p>He detected the Black Nether King’s darkness energy and frigid yin energy.</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong had added some roadblocks along the path to the inner hall when he entered, these formations probably could delay Black Nether King and Yuan Fang for half an hour.</p>
			<p>Half an hour!</p>
			<p>Therefore, Huang Xiaolong only had half an hour to make a safe exit.</p>
			<p>If he couldn’t finish the assimilation process within half an hour before Black Nether King and Yuan Fang arrived, his progress would be interrupted, and the second attempt would be more difficult.</p>
			<p>However, Huang Xiaolong knew very well that it was in these kinds of pressing crucial moments that one couldn’t lose their calm, thus his mind became clearer and calmer instead.</p>
			<p>Half an hour later.</p>
			<p>Two overwhelming auras arrived with world-shaking momentums. </p>
			<p>Naturally, these two were Black Nether King and Yuan Fang. When they arrived and saw Huang Xiaolong’s nameless devil mirror, it immediately rang an alarm in their heads.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you want to take away the devil mirror… Don’t dream of it!” Black Nether King snorted coldly as his palm struck at Huang Xiaolong. Sky-high waves of darkness energy and frigid yin energy slammed towards Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang took out something that resembled a squarish item that looked like a cube and began attacking Huang Xiaolong. This magic cube was the Origin Universe’s universe treasure, comparable to the Universe Boat. </p>
			<p>The magic cube emitted colorful dazzling lights that shone on Huang Xiaolong in an instant.</p>
			<p>Facing the double attacks from Black Nether King and Yuan Fang, the Universe Boat flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body and fended off Yuan Fang’s magic cube attack. At the same time, the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared above Huang Xiaolong’s head. Its branches lowered, spewing robust star dragon qi, which created a protective barrier around Huang Xiaolong. The Four Origin Divine Fires also protected Huang Xiaolong’s four directions.</p>
			<p>The Golden Sun Circlets, Blade of Death, Three Gods Halberd, Yin Yang Flame Wheel, Crow Devil Spear, Ghost Staff, and other universe treasures all flew out while Huang Xiaolong continued with the process of taking away the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s palm force knocked the Golden Sun Circlets, Blade of Death, Three Gods Halberd, Yin Yang Flame Wheel, Crow Devil Spear, Ghost Staff, and other universe treasures out of the way one after another.</p>
			<p>Even so, Black Nether King’s palm force bulldozed forward, until it collided with the Four Origin Divine Fires’ sea of fires. Shockingly, the Four Origin Divine Fires’ sea of fires were actually frozen!</p>
			<p>The Four Origin Divine Fires were the bane to darkness and frigid coldness, but now, they were actually frozen by the Black Nether King’s power of darkness and frigid cold energy!</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s palm force hit on the star dragon boundary created by Star Dragon Divine Tree. The star dragon power scattered and the star dragon boundary shattered!</p>
			<p>Black Nether King watched with a grim face.</p>
			<p>After Black Nether King’s palm force shattered the Star Dragon Divine Tree’s protective boundary, Yuan Fang’s magic cube collided with the Universe Boat. A thunderous explosion ensued. The Universe Boat was knocked out of the way, and the magic cube shot towards Huang Xiaolong. As Huang Xiaolong was trying to take away the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, he merely allotted one-tenth of his strength to the Universe Boat, which was why the Universe Boat failed to block the magic cube.</p>
			<p>Seeing that Black Nether King’s attack and Yuan Fang’s magic cube were about to land a blow on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong’s body suddenly emitted dazzling light as thirteen images appeared around him. Black Nether King and Yuan Fang’s attacks all fell on these thirteen images.</p>
			<p>Rumble~!</p>
			<p>Heaven and earth shook.</p>
			<p>The shock waves from Black Nether King and Yuan Fang’s attacks shattered numerous dimensions within the Devil Mirror Palace’s inner hall.</p>
			<p>The thirteen images’ light also dimmed considerably, and the collision caused a certain degree of internal injury to Huang Xiaolong, and blood trickled down the corner of his mouth.</p>
			<p>This was the first time Huang Xiaolong suffered injury since his battle against the Heaven Devouring King in the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King and Yuan Fang stared at the thirteen images of universes around Huang Xiaolong in astonishment.</p>
			<p>Both of them had a good understanding of their own strengths, and their attacks just now could have shattered anything in the universe, yet both of their attacks were blocked by those thirteen images.</p>
			<p>“These are?!” Black Nether King was genuinely shocked looking at the esoterics and laws within the thirteen universes’ images.</p>
			<p>Right at this moment, the Taiji symbol altar shook, and the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror fell straight into Huang Xiaolong’s palm.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was overjoyed, as he had finally succeeded in obtaining the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror!</p>
			<p>Without wasting any time, Huang Xiaolong put away the namessles devil mirror and the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror into his body.</p>
			<p>Seeing this, Black Nether King and Yuan Fang tacitly made their moves, one from the front and one from the back, pinching Huang Xiaolong in the middle.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, hand over the devil mirror!” Yuan Fang demanded with an unsightly expression as he extended his palm, “Hand over the small devil mirror as well, you won’t be able to escape today!” </p>
			<p>Never in his wildest imagination did it occur to him that Huang Xiaolong would be able to take away the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror!</p>
			<p>The Devil Mirror Palace had appeared many times before, and he had tried many methods to take away the devil mirror without any success.</p>
			<p>What’s with Huang Xiaolong’s small devil mirror? In the universe, is there a set of big and small devil mirrors?</p>
			<p>Black Nether King did not speak, he was entirely enshrouded in darkness, but it did not diminish the coldness of his gaze on Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong let out a sarcastic sneer at Black Nether King and Yuan Fang, “Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, the Origin Universe’s devil mirror is in my hands now. It’s already a certainty that I will break through to Universe God Realm after comprehending the devil mirror. If you two submit to me now, I won’t treat you badly after my advancement, however, if you block my path, you two will absolutely die once I break through to Universe God!”</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang was too stunned to react for a second, then erupted into hysterical laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, you sure can talk big. So what if you’ve got the Origin Universe’s devil mirror? Do you really think you can break through to Universe God Realm? The universe has existed for countless eras, but no one has ever crossed that step and successfully broken through to Universe God Realm. That is because it’s simply impossible!”</p>
			<p>“Stop daydreaming!” Yuan Fang mocked.</p>
			<p>Enshrouded in the darkness, Black Nether King stated in a flat tone, “Hand over the devil mirror, or die!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter, “In that case, fight!”</p>
			<p>Even if Black Nether King and Yuan Fang joined hands, what did he have to fear?</p>
			<p>“Kill!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong recalled the Universe Boat and blocked off Yuan Fang’s attack, and Yuan Fang’s magic cube rammed forward instead of retreating.</p>
			<p>Dong—!</p>
			<p>The Universe Boat and magic cube once again collided, this time, Yuan Fang’s magic cube was knocked away and Yuan Fang himself staggered quite a distance from the impact.</p>
			<p>Although Yuan Fang was hailed as the Origin Universe’s number one expert, his comprehension towards the thirteen universes’ esoterics and laws was a little lacking compared to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>A wave of terrifying energy suddenly loomed behind Huang Xiaolong’s back but Huang Xiaolong didn’t even give it a look, and he merely sent a palm strike to the back.</p>
			<p>Bang!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong and Black Nether King’s palms met head-on in the air.</p>
			<p>A wave of extreme frigid coldness drilled into Huang Xiaolong’s body through his palm, spreading to other parts rapidly. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, and quickly circulated his three worlds’ cosmos energy, yet he failed to expel the frigid coldness out of his body. He had never encountered such overbearing and frightening frigid coldness. No wonder the Four Origin Divine Fires were frozen.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s true body had always been a mystery for no one had ever seen his true body.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s second attack arrived while Huang Xiaolong was still in shock, in a ball of black light, resembling a falling black meteor that crashed straight on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Even before the second attack arrived, terrifying darkness energy, and frigid coldness had frozen Huang Xiaolong’s immediate space.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless, and he circulated the Universe Transformation Art. The thirteen universe images reappeared, and at the same time, he held the Crow Devil Spear in his left hand, and the Universe Boat in his right. He attacked the Black Nether King simultaneously with both the weapons. </p>
			<p>Seizing this window, Yuan Fang’s magic cube made a sneak attack on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong, Black Nether King, and Yuan Fang’s intense battle caused a great deal of damage to the surrounding space, even the Taiji symbol altar hummed incessantly due to the three people’s destructive force.</p>
			<p>Other than the altar, everything else within the inner hall was reduced to chaotic space, shattering into nothingness. </p>
			<p>As the battle between the three intensified, a monstrous cosmic storm of darkness energy and light of nothingness rampaged. At any other time, any one of these elements could easily reap the life of an expert of twenty billion mark.</p>
			<p>Old Man Fortune, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and other experts above twenty-billion mark battle strength still had not made it into the inner hall, yet they could feel the violent energy fluctuations from billions of miles away.</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and others’ faces turned white as ghosts at the magnitude of the destructive power.</p>
			<p>Even Old Man Fortune’s expression had never been so solemn.</p>
			<p>The weakest one amongst these people, Heaven Sage Human Emperor looked deathly pale as he asked feebly, “Are we heading there?” He had barely asked out the question, when he saw Old Man Fortune float silently in the direction where Huang Xiaolong, Black Nether King, and Yuan Fang were.</p>
			<p>Seeing this, Buddha Sage Human Emperor took a deep breath and said, “With all of us joining hands, what’s there to be afraid of, go!”</p>
			<p>He acted first and floated towards Huang Xiaolong’s direction, and the other seven Human Emperors followed, including the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, albeit reluctantly.</p>
			<p>When Buddha Sage Human Emperor and others got close, all of them sucked in a breath of cold air watching Huang Xiaolong, Black Nether King, and Yuan Fang’s battle. There was no longer sky or land in their battlefield, only nothingness. Nothing remained under Huang Xiaolong, Black Nether King, and Yuan Fang’s overwhelming destructive powers.</p>
			<p>“Where’s the devil mirror?!” someone suddenly asked out loud.</p>
			<p>The one who spoke was an expert called Lucid Emperor, the old ancestor of the Illuminate Race of Origin Universe. He was one of the Origin Universe’s top ten experts, with battle strength at twenty-nine billion mark.</p>
			<p>Being reminded by the Lucid Emperor’s question, the others immediately noticed that the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror was gone.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong has taken away the devil mirror. Everyone, come, kill Huang Xiaolong!” </p>
			<p>While everyone was looking around suspiciously, Yuan Fang in the far distance suddenly yelled towards them. </p>
			<p>Yuan Fang’s words raised a tsunami of furor, shocking all the experts who finally reached the inner hall. In an instant, all eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong.𝐟𝗿𝗲𝗲𝐰𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺</p>
			<p>Old Man Fortune blurred into a flicker, and started attacking Huang Xiaolong without a word.</p>
			<p>Seeing this, other experts exchanged a glance, and all of them swarmed into the fray, bombarding attacks on Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Even though Huang Xiaolong had three worlds, 29.9 billion mark battle strength, and comprehended the thirteen universes’ esoterics and laws, being besieging by a group of powerful experts consisting of Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, Old Man Fortune, and others, made him fall into a disadvantage. </p>
			<p>In the end, Huang Xiaolong had to retreat as he battled, deeper into the Devil Mirror Palace’s inner hall.</p>
			<p>This battle went on for several months.</p>
			<p>In these several months, Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, Old Man Fortune, and a dozen other experts persistently dogged Huang Xiaolong. If it wasn’t for the thirteen universes’ images to protect him, his physical body would have been destroyed by now. Even so, Huang Xiaolong suffered heavy injuries. Then again, Huang Xiaolong also burst the bodies of twenty-plus experts who had been chasing after him, and one of them was the Heaven Sage Human Emperor. </p>
			<p>Currently, only experts with twenty-nine billion mark battle strength remained standing.</p>
			<p>This battle could only be described as tragic.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you won’t be able to escape in front is the Devil Mirror Palace’s Devil Light Region! Even I won’t be able to last one hour inside the Devil Light Region!” Yuan Fang said as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong’s back and mocked coldly.</p>
			<p>Behind Huang Xiaolong were beams of devil lights booming down from the void. They were thick as an adult’s arm and looked like a single-colored rainbow hanging from above.</p>
			<p>Although Huang Xiaolong had not crossed over to the Devil Light Region, his gut was already screaming danger. Clearly, what Yuan Fang had said was the truth.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, there’s no place for you to retreat anymore, hand out the big and small devil mirrors. As long as you hand them out, I can guarantee that you’ll leave safely!” Black Nether King's cold, gloomy voice sounded. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong merely snorted, then he turned around and leaped into the Devil Light Region. </p>
			<p>His figure soon disappeared from sight in the depths of the Devil Light Region.</p>
			<p>It was already too late for Yuan Fang to stop Huang Xiaolong when he realized Huang Xiaolong was leaping into the Devil Light Region. In a hurry, he also entered the Devil Light Region but it wasn’t long before he exited in a sorry state.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King also entered and came out a short while later.</p>
			<p>Old Man Fortune didn’t fare any better than the two.</p>
			<p>“D*mn it!” Yuan Fang cursed angrily under his breath.</p>
			<p>The devil mirror was on Huang Xiaolong’s body, and now that Huang Xiaolong had entered the Devil Light Region, it meant that the devil mirror would be left inside the Devil Light Region, and no one would be able to get the devil mirror anymore!</p>
			<p>Old Man Fortune’s expression was just as ugly. He had traversed countless spatial dimensions and triumphed over various obstacles to arrive at the Origin Universe, all for finding a chance to break through to Universe God Realm but, now, the path of advancement was broken off by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, you d*mn b*stard!” Old Man Fortune couldn’t help bellowing to vent his frustration and anger.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King did not utter a sound, except for staring at the spot where Huang Xiaolong disappeared with an icy gaze. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, Buddha Sage Human Emperor was inwardly relieved seeing Huang Xiaolong disappear into the Devil Light Region.</p>
			<p>Even so, no one left immediately, but they stayed and waited outside. A day later, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor said to the other Human Emperors, “A day has passed, so Huang Xiaolong’s definitely died inside. Let’s go.”</p>
			<p>There were many other treasures inside the Devil Mirror Palace after all, they couldn’t be guarding there the whole time. Every time the Devil Mirror Palace appeared, it was only for several years. After several years, it would return to the bottom of the gorge, therefore, they needed to seize the time to look for as many treasures as possible.</p>
			<p>As the group of eight Human Emperors left, the Lucid Emperor and others also left soon after. </p>
			<p>In the end, only Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, Old Man Fortune, and Lord of Ghost Desert stayed behind.</p>
			<p>When another day passed, Old Man Fortune and Lord of Ghost Desert also gave up.</p>
			<p>Until four days later, Yuan Fang said to Black Nether King, “Huang Xiaolong must be dead inside. Waiting here anymore is useless, Huang Xiaolong won’t show up anymore.” With that said, he left rapidly.</p>
			<p>But Black Nether King waited another two days before he finally gave up and left.</p>
			<p>On the other side, Huang Xiaolong who was forced to enter the Devil Light Region, was subjected to pressure akin to great mountains coming at him from all around. Huang Xiaolong quickly circulated the Universe Transformation Art, and the thirteen universes images appeared. In the beginning, the thirteen universes' images did reduce the devil light beams’ pressure, but as time passed, the thirteen universes’ images began to float unsteadily. </p>
			<p>These devil light beams’ destructive power had far exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s estimation. Every beam of devil light’s destructive power was comparable to a combined attack from Black Nether King and Yuan Fang.</p>
			<p>Just imagine, what would happen to Huang Xiaolong under endless barrage from Black Nether King and Yuan Fang’s combined attacks?</p>
			<p>But just as Huang Xiaolong considered leaving the place, suddenly, an alarming and powerful devouring force swallowed Huang Xiaolong into its depths.</p>
			<p>By the time Huang Xiaolong reacted, he realized he had arrived in a world of light.</p>
			<p>Everywhere he looked was light, there was nothing else.</p>
			<p>All around was hazy light, and this scene reminded him when he passed through the Light Waterfall to reach Origin Universe. The difference was that the light in this place was a gentle kind of light. Huang Xiaolong found the light here contained unbelievable vitality and power of life. </p>
			<p>It gave him the feeling as if the Origin Universe was born from here…!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong tried to fly out of the place, but no matter which direction he flew, he was unable to reach the edge. </p>
			<p>In the end, Huang Xiaolong stopped. Since he couldn’t leave this place, he decided to comprehend the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror. As long as he successfully comprehended the Origin Universe’s esoterics and laws within the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, he would be able to break through to Universe God Realm, and then he could figure out how to get out of this place.</p>
			<p>Thus, Huang Xiaolong found a comfortable spot and sat cross-legged and took out both the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror and his own nameless devil mirror, and began to focus on comprehending them.</p>
			<p>……</p>
			<p>Several years went by in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>Experts that entered the Devil Mirror Palace all rushed out when the time was up, and the Devil Mirror Palace once again returned to the bottom of the Golden Gorge.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, Old Man Fortune, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others watched the Devil Mirror Palace descend into the Golden Gorge and disappear from their sights.</p>
			<p>“Even if Huang Xiaolong survived inside the Devil Light Region, he’s bound to lose his life at the bottom of the Golden Gorge, no one could come out alive from the bottom of the Golden Gorge!” Yuan Fang said with absolute certainty before he turned and left.</p>
			<p>Other experts also left, either alone or with their companions.</p>
			<p>The last people to leave were the Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune.</p>
			<p>Before long, the news about Huang Xiaolong being besieged by Black Nether King, Yuan Fang, and other experts, and finally dying inside the Devil Mirror Palace’s Devil Light Region spread.</p>
			<p>“The Devil Light Region! Even Lord Yuan Fang couldn’t survive an hour inside. Huang Xiaolong did not come out after several days, so probably even his dao soul had turned into dust!”</p>
			<p>“What a pity. I’ve heard that the devil mirror was in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, and he brought it into the Devil Light Region. Who can get the devil mirror now? The only chance to break through to Universe God is lost!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s death caused a storm in the Origin Universe. After all, the shocking sight of Huang Xiaolong repelling the eight Human Emperors was still fresh in the minds of the Gods of Creation gathered at the Golden Gorge.</p>
			<p>But as time passed, Huang Xiaolong was gradually forgotten by the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>And the news of Huang Xiaolong’s death also reached the Thirteen Universes’ Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>“What, Huang, Huang Xiaolong’s dead?!” When the Ferocious Devil heard the news, he highly doubted it.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Old Man Fortune said it himself. It is said that Huang Xiaolong was besieged by Black Nether King, and Origin Universe’s strongest expert, Yuan Fang, and several others, and he ran into a place called the Devil Light Region. Even the Black Nether King couldn’t last for an hour in there, whereas, Huang Xiaolong didn’t come out even after several days.”</p>
			<p>Green Ghost sighed with a complicated expression. “Pity!”</p>
			<p>Ferocious Devil looked extremely gloomy.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was his hope, as well as the hope of the Unknown Space and the Thirteen Universes. If Huang Xiaolong was dead, then who was going to hold off the Universe First Race? </p>
			<p>“There is another bad news,” Green Ghost hesitated for a second before speaking. “It’s said that Black Nether King found the Universe Source Stone inside the Devil Mirror Palace! In fact, he found two!”</p>
			<p>“What?!” Ferocious Devil exclaimed in utter loss.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King actually found two Universe Source Stones!</p>
			<p>“But I’ve heard there’s a problem with the Universe First Race’s Extermination Grand Formation, so Black Nether King ordered them to refine the Boundary Breaking Grand Formation anew, and increased the formation’s power at the same time. Therefore, there are still several million years before Black Nehter King can use the Boundary Breaking Formation,” Green Ghost elaborated.</p>
			<p>Problems occurring with the formation were naturally due to Huang Xiaolong’s little trick on the formation’s rune in the past.</p>
			<p>“Several million years.” Ferocious Devil sighed, “That means we only have that long to live? Everything within the Thirteen Universes would be reduced to nothingness after that?!” </p>
			<p>Green Ghost nodded. “I’ve heard Old Man Fortune has already led the entire Fortune Space’s experts to submit to Black Nether King.”</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>Several million years went by in the blink of an eye.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King had refined the Extermination Formation anew, doubling the formation’s power.</p>
			<p>On this day, all the experts in the Unknown Space saw a burst of light in the horizon. Space suddenly cracked and shattered as a destructive force swept towards every corner of the Unknown Space.</p>
			<p>Ferocious Devil stood in the air above the capital city, staring into space as he spoke, “Black Nether King, do you think you would be able to break through to Universe God Realm by extracting and absorbing all Thirteen Universes’ vitality through the Extermination Formation? Stop dreaming because you’ll never step across that line for eternity!”</p>
			<p>In the void, Black Nether King emerged from the darkness that usually shrouded around him, and let out a snicker of disdain, “I’ve got two Universe Source Stones, doubling the power of Extermination Formation. I definitely can break through to Universe God Realm, but unfortunately, Ferocious Devil, you won’t be able to see that day!”</p>
			<p>With that said, he increased the Extermination Formation’s power, and immediately, the Devil Capital’s space shattered. Everything was on the verge of being reduced to dust. Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Zhu Chen, and others were enveloped by the Extermination Formation’s power. Their bodies shattered and turned into speckles of vitality, including their dao souls, and accumulated in the center of the Extermination Formation.</p>
			<p>Then, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and others, including other emperors in the Unknown Space, were broken into vitality and sucked into the formation.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty Black Nether King, the Unknown Space is completely exterminated. Is our next target the First Universe?” One of the Universe First Race’s experts asked Black Nether King.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King paused for a second before stating, “I heard that Huang Xiaolong’s master and family, and his women are all in the Blazing Dragon Universe. Is that right?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, according to our investigation, Huang Xiaolong’s master, family, and women are all in the Blazing Dragon Universe.” The Universe First Race’s experts promptly replied in a respectful manner.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King snorted coldly, “To show my respect to Huang Xiaolong, we’ll exterminate the Blazing Dragon Universe, I want to go there personally, and pinch Huang Xiaolong’s women to death one by one!”</p>
			<p>If it wasn’t for Huang Xiaolong, he would have gotten the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Majesty Black Nether King!” </p>
			<p>Black Nether King personally led the Universe First Race’s experts to the Blazing Dragon Universe, and activated the Extermination Formation. The Blazing Dragon Universe’s layer shattered and crumbled, and the entire universe fell into panic and despair, as cries of fear and horror reverberated.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King and First Universe Race’s experts had kept the World of Departed Souls for last.</p>
			<p>Inside the World of Departed Souls, Pangu, Huang Long, Blazing Dragon, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, as well as Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and others were looking apprehensively at the First Universe Race’s expert gathered at the world’s boundary.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s indifferent voice rang, “Do you think that I won’t be able to do anything to you all if you hide inside this innate world?”</p>
			<p>With that said, he raised his fist and punched in front of him. Merely one punch was all he needed to break the World of Departed Souls’ defenses into pieces, and the whole world shook violently.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King took one stride forward and entered the World of Departed Souls.</p>
			<p>All of Universe First Race experts swarmed inside.</p>
			<p>Pangu and the others paled at this sight.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King stood high in the air with his hands clasped behind him, and his condescending gaze swept over Pangu, Blazing Dragon, Huang Long, and the others. “You guys are Huang Xiaolong’s master, father, and mother?”</p>
			<p>Lastly, his gaze fell on Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and other women. “And Huang Xiaolong’s women?” </p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong’s taste is so bad, he’s interested in rubbish below God of Creation Realm.” Black Nether King’s mocking contempt rang loud and clear.</p>
			<p>Though Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and the others were beautiful in their own rights, their cultivation was below the God of Creation Realm, thus in Black Nether King’s eyes, they were rubbish.</p>
			<p>These kinds of women weren’t even qualified to be rewarded as the lowest grade of maid to his disciple’s subordinate’s subordinate’s subordinate’s subordinate.</p>
			<p>Pangu’s sonorous voice sounded, “You’re the Universe First Race’s Black Nether King? Even if you extracted the thirteen universes’ vitality, you will never break through to Universe God Realm. The winner in that spot will definitely be my disciple, Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
			<p>Black Nether King snickered harshly upon hearing that, “Your disciple Huang Xiaolong? Let me tell you that Huang Xiaolong died several million years ago.”</p>
			<p>“What?!” Blood drained off Pangu, Huang Long, Blazing Dragon, and the others’ faces. </p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi’s group of women looked even worse.</p>
			<p>“No, no, impossible! Xiaolong won’t die!” Shi Xiaofei denied with her heart and soul despite the tears running down her face.</p>
			<p>“Impossible?!” Black Nether King sneered, “Several million years ago, Huang Xiaolong, I, and Old Man Fortune entered the Origin Universe. Later on, inside the Origin Universe’s Devil Mirror Palace, he tried to snatch the devil mirror away, and ended up being besieged by more than a dozen experts of twenty-seven billion mark battle strength. In the end, he was forced to flee into the Devil Light Region!”</p>
			<p>“The Devil Light Region, that kind of place even I won’t last an hour inside, but Huang Xiaolong entered such a place and didn’t come out after several days!”</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s voice reverberated above the World of Departed Souls.</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi and the other women swayed unsteadily, looking as if the sky had fallen. Although Huang Xiaolong did not return all these years, he had always been their sky.</p>
			<p>Now, their sky was gone!</p>
			<p>“Bullsh*t!” Pangu roared at Black Nether King, “Xiaolong can’t be dead! He has three worlds, and he is the only person who accomplished that. He won’t die!”</p>
			<p>A cold sneer escaped Black Nether King’s lips as he pointed a finger at Pangu and Pangu exploded, leaving golden blood mists scattered in the air. With a grip, Black Nether King was holding Pangu’s dao soul in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Brother Pangu!” Huang Long and Blazing Dragon cried out.</p>
			<p>There was no temperature in Black Nether King’s eyes as he looked at Pangu’s dao soul. “Anyone who opposes me must die, Huang Xiaolong is no exception. You are not an exception. However, killing an ant like you dirties my hand. If you’re not Huang Xiaolong’s master, I’m too lazy to spare a glance on an ant like you.”</p>
			<p>With that said, he threw Pangu’s dao soul into the center of the Extermination Formation.</p>
			<p>Huang Long and the others were outraged and fought desperately against Black Nether King, but their bodies exploded simultaneously with one strike from Black Nether King’s palm. Their dao souls subsequently were thrown into the Extermination Formation.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King dealt with Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and the rest in the same manner, bursting their bodies and throwing their souls into the formation until the last group of Huang Xiaolong’s women remained.</p>
			<p>Looking at Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the others, Black Nether King suddenly changed his mind, “Well, their looks are not bad. It seems a bit wasteful to kill them just like that.” The corner of his lips curved into a sinister smile as he said to the experts behind him, “Take them all back to the Firmament of the Universe. They should be rewarded to the disciples below according to merits as chambermaids.” </p>
			<p>Chambermaids!</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and the others’ paled visibly and immediately thought of exploding themselves, but to their horror, they were unable to move, and their bodies were completely out of their control.</p>
			<p>……</p>
			<p>At the bottom of Golden Gorge, inside the Devil Mirror Palace’s light space, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in the air. There was bright light everywhere as thirteen universes’ images circulated around him, and suspended above his head were brightly shining small and big devil mirrors. At this moment, a startling transformation was happening inside Huang Xiaolong’s body.</p>
			<p>The cosmos energy within Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds roared and then… an abrupt explosion happened. His golden-colored cosmos energy evolved into a color of nothingness!</p>
			<p>At the same time, his three dao souls grew increasingly bigger, until at one point, they floated out of Huang Xiaolong’s body and integrated with the Devil Mirror Palace. No, in essence, the three souls integrated with the entire universe as one entity!</p>
			<p>Strands of universe esoterics and laws condensed in front of Huang Xialong and solidified, and finally, they formed an image of light that was bigger than the thirteen universes’ images!</p>
			<p>The Origin Universe’s image!</p>
			<p>Now, there were fourteen universe light images!</p>
			<p>When the fourteen universes’ image gathered, indescribable energy spread through heaven and earth, and the whole Devil Mirror Palace’s space quaked, as the tremors spread throughout the entire Golden Gorge!</p>
			<p>Then, the dessert where the Golden Gorge was located shook!</p>
			<p>The quaking continued to spread further to the surrounding lands. </p>
			<p>“What’s going on?!” Inside the hall, the Lord of Ghost Desert was alarmed and flew out to investigate.</p>
			<p>“Master, it seems to be coming from the Golden Gorge! Something happened in the Golden Gorge!” His disciple pointed out uncertainty as he observed the horizon. </p>
			<p>Golden Gorge? The Lord of Ghost Desert blanked momentarily.</p>
			<p>The quaking extended further outwards, and soon, all the experts of Origin Universe felt the frightening quakes. </p>
			<p>The quaking even extended out from the Origin Universe, passing through the three thousand innate barriers, reaching the thirteen universes.</p>
			<p>One after another of the thirteen universes’ experts felt the quakes that were happening throughout the whole universe. Lastly, the quaking reached the Blazing Dragon Universe, reaching the World of Departed Souls.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King was stunned when he sensed the abnormality. He raised his head and looked up with a stunned expression.</p>
			<p>“What’s going on?” The Universe First Race’s experts exchanged baffled glances amongst themselves.</p>
			<p>A moment later, the quakes abruptly disappeared.</p>
			<p>In the Origin Universe’s Golden Gorge, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes opened, and in the next second, he disappeared from the Golden Gorge. When he reappeared, he was already in the Blazing Dragon Universe!</p>
			<p>Almost in a matter of a split second, he had reached the Blazing Dragon Universe from Origin Universe!</p>
			<p>If Yuan Fang saw this sight, he would be astounded.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong appeared in the Blazing Dragon Universe, his dao souls spread and coldness filled his eyes. In a single stride, he reached the world of Departed Souls.</p>
			<p>At this time, Black Nether King was about to leave the World of Departed Souls with the Universe First Race’s experts with Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and others in tow. He turned around only to discover there was actually someone standing behind him without him realizing it.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong?!” When Black Nether King saw who it was, the shock was written all over his face, thinking his eyes were playing a trick on him.</p>
			<p>Didn’t Huang Xiaolong die inside the Devil Mirror Palace? How did he appear here suddenly?</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and the others were in despair when they heard an unexpected yell from Black Nether King. A shiver ran down their backs as they raised their heads and saw Huang Xiaolong’s familiar face.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong!” Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and others cried out with tears of joy.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King suddenly laughed as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect you to have survived inside the Devil Mirror Palace’s Devil Light Region. What now? Do you want to save your women? I originally planned to take your women back and reward them to my Universe First Race disciples!”</p>
			<p>He was surprised but unconcerned by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden appearance. Huang Xiaolong might be slightly stronger than him, but only slightly.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong raised his arm, and caught Black Nether King enshrouded in darkness energy by the neck. His fingers clutched tightly as he dragged Black Nether King towards him.</p>
			<p>Black Nether King’s eyes protruded from the pressure, and there was an unknown fear in his eyes, as well as bewilderment.</p>
			<p>How did I end up in Huang Xiaolong’s hands?!</p>
			<p>He didn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong laid his hands on his neck. More importantly, he couldn’t muster any strength to resist. It was just like how he used to strangle the necks of the ‘insignificant ants’ while they were powerless against him.</p>
			<p>“You’ve already…?!” Black Nether King’s voice trailed off.</p>
			<p>The Universe First Race’s experts were scared stupid on the spot.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Black Nether King’s pale face with an indifferent gaze. “You’ve guessed right. I’ve already broken through to Universe God.”</p>
			<p>“No, no, impossible!” Black Nether King denied dazedly, “No, no, this can’t be happening!”</p>
			<p>In order to break through to Universe God Realm, he had been diligently making effort for countless years. He had imagined many times the moment he advanced to Universe God. Even if there was only one person who could rise to that place, it could only be him!</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to waste time with Black Nether King anymore, so he exerted force in his fingers and burst Black Nether King’s body. When Black Nether King’s dao soul ran out to escape, it exploded into smithereens with one tap from Huang Xiaolong’s finger.</p>
			<p>In the next second, a burst of light shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s pupils and all Universe First Race’s experts were reduced to nothingness in an instant, and they disappeared from the world.</p>
			<p>The breaths that Shi Xiaofei and the others held onto left their bodies and their bodies relaxed. They rushed towards Huang Xiaolong, crying out of joy.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong, father, mother, and the others were killed by Black Nether King!” Shi Xiaofei cried woefully. </p>
			<p>“It’s fine,” Huang Xiaolong comforted, and he then reached out and retrieved Huang Long, Pangu, Blazing Dragon, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and others’ dao souls from the Extermination Formation. He blew a breath over their dao souls, and everyone’s physical bodies completely recovered as they were before.</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, and the others watched the whole process with agape expressions.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong, you’re back!” Huang Long, Pangu, Blazing Dragon, and those who died earlier had recovered good as new. Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong, all of them were ecstatic. In truth, they had clearly seen Huang Xiaolong kill Black Nether King from the Extermination Formation. </p>
			<p>“Father, Mother, Master!” Huang Xiaolong smiled. “I’m back.”</p>
			<p>“That’s good, that’s good ah!” Huang Peng grinned happily.</p>
			<p>Wang Meilan glared at Huang Xiaolong and chided jokingly, “Smelly brat, you won’t go out anymore after this, right?”</p>
			<p>Su Yan chimed in, “That’s right, this time you cannot leave anymore. At least, you, Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi, and the others must give me a few grandchildren first.”</p>
			<p>Everyone laughed happily.</p>
			<p>The women’s faces blushed deeply hearing the meaning of those words.</p>
			<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t go out anymore,” Huang Xiaolong said as he looked at Shi Xiaofei and the others with a wicked smile. “We’ll work hard tonight!”</p>

			</title>
			<p>Su Yan and Wang Meilan beamed when they heard Huang Xiaolong agree to work hard that night.</p>
			<p>“Smelly brat, you’ve given your word.” Su Yan smiled at Huang Xiaolong. “If you don’t make an effort to give us a few grandsons and granddaughters, we won’t spare you.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Don’t worry, Mother. Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the others will give birth to ten children, each of them!”</p>
			<p>Each of us will give birth to ten children?!</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and Yaochi were especially frightened, thinking how Huang Xiaolong would treat them that night, and their faces reddened further as their heartbeat raced.</p>
			<p>Then they heard Wang Meilan’s voice. “How could each person giving birth to ten children be enough? Each of them must give birth to at least twenty!” </p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and Yaochi felt like fainting on the spot.</p>
			<p>Huang Long, Huang Peng, and Huang Jiyuan smiled wryly in silence. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong could only grin in agreement. “Alright, twenty children each of them!” </p>
			<p>He winked at Shi Xiaofei and the others, causing the women to blush even harder.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong, the Blazing Dragon Universe, except for the World of Departed Souls, and all other worlds were exterminated by Black Nether King. Can you see if…?” Blazing Dragon struggled internally before bringing up the matter to Huang Xiaolong. </p>
			<p>“Master, don’t worry,” Huang Xiaolong reassured him. With a wave of his hand, all the vitality devoured by the Extermination Formation flowed in reverse, and as Huang Xiaolong’s hands continued to move, the returning vitality restored everything to what it used to be. The worlds that were destroyed, the continents, creeds and sacred lands were rebuilt like a movie being played backwards.</p>
			<p>The mountains and rivers, spiritual beasts, mortals, and everything within these great worlds were restored until there was no difference from before.</p>
			<p>Soon, the Blazing Dragon Universe was also restored completely.</p>
			<p>Blazing Dragon, Huang Long, Pangu, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and others were wide-eyed with astonishment watching everything that transpired.</p>
			<p>“This, the Universe God Realm is f*cking heaven-defying!” Pangu couldn’t resist muttering.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “In the future, I will be the fourteen universes’ heaven, and everything in the fourteen universes would live or die based on my thought.”</p>
			<p>Pangu swallowed hard. “Xiaolong, that, erm, does that mean you can create anything we need out of thin air?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, and then smiled as he answered, “You can say so.”</p>
			<p>As the sovereign of the fourteen universes, the things he wanted to create merely requires a single thought.</p>
			<p>Hearing it straight from the horse’s mouth, Huang Long, old dragon, and the others were jarred speechless.</p>
			<p>Can create anything!</p>
			<p>Does that mean whatever wishes they had could be fulfilled?</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Long and Yilong wryly. “Father, Mother, just tell me what wishes you have. As long as it does not go against nature and harmony, I can fulfill them.”</p>
			<p>Huang Long and Yilong’s hearts jumped. Could Huang Xiaolong see through other people’s thoughts as well? </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong merely smiled as he went on, “The Unknown Space was exterminated by Black Nether King as well, so I’ll go over there now.”</p>
			<p>Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yaochi and the other women paled with worry when they heard that.</p>
			<p>“Xiaolong, you’re going away again?” Shi Xiaofei asked with an obviously anxious face.</p>
			<p>Seeing Shi Xiaofei and other women’s expressions, he understood their worries. “Don’t worry, it won’t take long, I’ll be back before you know it. It’ll be an hour at most.” He playfully reminded them as he continued, “I promised Mother that I’ll work hard tonight.” </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s latter sentence made the women shoot him fierce glares with blushing faces.</p>
			<p>Before Shi Xiaofei and the other women’s blushing glares, Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a blur, leaving a soft chuckle in the air. He left the Blazing Dragon Universe, and arrived at the edge of the First Universe where Unknown Space used to be in the next moment. </p>
			<p>In the original location where the Unknown Space used to be was a broken and chaotic void, and there wasn’t a trace of vitality. Death qi loomed and faint scent of blood was left behind by the Extermination Formation.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand across the space in front of him, and immediately, strands of light broke through the darkness and enveloped the void. Slowly, the shattered Unknown Space began to piece itself back and it was finally restored to its original state.</p>
			<p>Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the vitality that belonged to the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Zhu Chen, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and the others from the Extermination Formation and released them.</p>
			<p>As Huang Xiaolong’s fingers danced in the air, the Devil Land, Limitless Land, Zhulan Land, and other lands recovered one by one.</p>
			<p>It was like a magic show, and everything that had once disappeared was recovered and restored.</p>
			<p>Mountain ranges on the great lands, the towering ancient trees as well as the smallest of seedlings, the insects, and spiritual beasts, everything reappeared. In the end, Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and many others were resurrected.</p>
			<p>Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang, Tao Haner, and all experts in the Unknown Space had incredulous expressions on their faces when they discovered they were resurrected.“We, we’re resurrected?!” Green Ghost asked in amazement as he checked his own body from top to bottom several times, pinching and squishing here and there.</p>
			<p>“Correct, all of you are resurrected.” A voice brought them out of their state of shock. They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong who appeared out of nowhere.</p>
			<p>Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Ferocious Devil fell loudly on his knees and kowtowed in gratitude. “Ferocious Devil thanks Lord God Universe for resurrecting my life!”</p>
			<p>Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Death God, Jian Wushuang reacted when they saw Ferocious Devil’s action, and all of them followed, full of gratitude towards Huang Xiaolong. Their dao souls too had witnessed the scene where Huang Xiaolong had killed Black Nether King. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong had everyone stand up. </p>
			<p>Tao Haner called out shyly to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord.”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong turned and smiled, looking at Tao Haner. “Haner, I’ll bring you back to the Blazing Dragon Universe with me after this.”</p>
			<p>Now that he had broken through to Universe God Realm, Huang Xiaolong also thought through many things.</p>
			<p>“Yes!” Tao Haner flushed with excitement and joy as she nodded her head.</p>
			<p>“Wait here a while for me. I need to go to the Origin Universe,” Huang Xiaolong smiled and said seeing Tao Haner agree. He vanished from sight, and before the foot he raised fell in place, he was back at the Origin Universe almost instantaneously. In the past, he had crossed many obstacles and hardships to reach the Origin Universe, but now, it was merely the effort of a thought.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong spread his dao souls and soon found Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the rest. A cold snort escaped his lips, and he chose Yuan Fang as the first target.</p>
			<p>At this time, Yuan Fang’s celestial palace was extremely lively. He was holding a banquet and had invited various experts from the Origin Universe.</p>
			<p>Several hundred million years ago, Yuan Fang had managed to comprehend a supreme technique inside the Devil Mirror Palace, and his strength had improved further during this time. Yuan Fang felt his hope of breaking through to the Universe God Realm was closer within his reach. Due to this he was overjoyed and held a banquet.</p>
			<p>In the banquet, the Lord of Ghost Desert raised his wine cup to make a toast at Yuan Fang in a respectful manner, “Congratulations Lord Yuan Fang in successfully comprehending a supreme technique. When Lord Yuan Fang breaks through to Universe God Realm, you’ll be the only sovereign of the fourteen universes!”</p>
			<p>Buddha Sage Human Emperor and others also stood up, raising their wine cups for a toast, with a hint of flattery. </p>
			<p>Yuan Fang laughed heartily, “I’ll borrow everyone’s auspicious words, and if I break through to Universe God Realm in the future, I, naturally, won’t treat anyone badly.”𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝑒𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝒸𝑜𝘮</p>
			<p>The Lucid Race’s ancestor, Lucid Emperor, stood up and said, “I’ve heard that, upon returning, Black Nether King used the two Universe Source Stones he obtained to forge out an Extermination Formation to extract all thirteen universes’ vitality to help him breakthrough to Universe God.”</p>
			<p>Hearing that, Yuan Fang’s unconcealed harsh snicker sounded through the hall. “Black Nether King is a fool through and through. Those methods are merely external resources. Even if he extracts the thirteen universes’ vitality a hundred times over, he wouldn’t be able to breakthrough into the Universe God Realm. To break through to that realm, one should comprehend supreme techniques like me, and advance.”</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang barely finished his words, when a cold and derisive sneer sounded, “Like you? Yuan Fang, do you think you’ll be the one who breaks through to Universe God?” </p>
			<p>Yuan Fang was startled by the familiar voice and slowly stood up from the main seat, looking towards the door. The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and others present also stood up and looked outside the hall. A young man was approaching at a leisurely pace.</p>
			<p>Who else could it be but Huang Xiaolong?</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong, yo-you didn’t die?!” The first thought that came to Yuan Fang’s mind was that Huang Xiaolong didn’t die inside the Devio Mirror Palace’s Devil Light Region. </p>
			<p>“I said it before on the day you besieged me that all of you will die the day I break through to Universe God!” Huang Xiaolong’s placid tone cut across the hall. </p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong strode into the hall.</p>
			<p>“Listening to your tone, it’s as if you’ve taken that step and broken through to Universe God.” Yuan Fang mocked. </p>
			<p>Merely several million years had passed since the last time the Devil Mirror Palace appeared, and he naturally did not believe Huang Xiaolong had advanced to Universe God in that short time.</p>
			<p>He walked down from the dais towards Huang Xiaolong, “We forced you to death’s end that time in the Mirror Devil Palace, and today, we can kill you once and for all. Even without Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune, we can kill you just the same!” </p>
			<p>He signaled others with his eyes, and the Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and others all spread out and encircled Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang then activated the formation around the hall, and bright lights soared to the sky, completely trapping Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang regained his confidence and composure.</p>
			<p>“Huang Xiaolong.” Just as Yuan Fang wanted to speak, Huang Xiaolong directly struck his palm at Yuan Fang, burying him through the floor and into the ground.</p>
			<p>The hall crumbled to the ground.</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the rest were waiting for Yuan Fang’s order to attack, but they were flabbergasted after watching Yuan Fang slapped into the ground by Huang Xiaolong.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong moved a little closer and looked into the pit in the ground where Yuan Fang was. “What did you want to say just now?”</p>
			<p>Yuan Fang coughed up a mouthful of blood, and he was bleeding all over, even the corners of his eyes were cracked. Huang Xiaolong’s strike had completely shattered his dao heart and dao veins, and there were even cracks all over his great world.</p>
			<p>He was horrified. “You, you’ve already…?!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong stated without any emotion, “Not long ago, I killed Black Nether King.”</p>
			<p>A chill ran down Yuan Fang’s back. The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others felt their knees soften.</p>
			<p>“What else do you want to say?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he peered at Yuan Fang.</p>
			<p>A bitter and tragic smile flashed across Yuan Fang’s face but he was stubborn. “Kill me if you want to. Do you think I will beg you? Dream on!”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong struck out with another palm strike.</p>
			<p>Violent quakes shook the entire great land.</p>
			<p>That strike sent Yuan Fang to the very, very depths of the land. His physical body, and dao soul exploded from the force. As for the pieces of remains, everything was left deep underground. </p>
			<p>“That’s nothing to dream about.” Huang Xiaolong merely glanced at Yuan Fang’s remains, and then looked away. “You think it’s funny, but I don’t.”</p>
			<p>The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and the others almost pissed themselves and quickly fell to their knees after seeing this.</p>
			<p>“Lord Universe God, spare us!”</p>
			<p>“We’re willing to submit to you. We were wrong!” The Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and all present experts sobbed woefully. Stupid as they might be, but they too had guessed that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Universe God.</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong remained unaffected. “That day, you all besieged me, wanting to snatch my devil mirrors. Did you give me a chance?”</p>
			<p>Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent did not escape the Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and other experts. All of them were prepared to flee for their lives, however, before they could turn around, all of them were sent deep underground with one palm strike. Just like Yuan Fang, their physiques, dao souls, and dao hearts shattered into particles.</p>
			<p>After dealing with Yuan Fang, Lord of Ghost Desert, Buddha Sage Human Emperor, and other experts, Huang Xiaolong left the Origin Universe. However, Huang Xiaolong did not return to the Blazing Dragon Universe immediately but made a detour to the Firmament of the Universe.</p>
			<p>Although Huang Xiaolong had killed Black Nether King, the White Feather King, and Old Man Fortune weren’t there. White Feather King and Old Man Fortune were currently at the Firmament of the Universe.</p>
			<p>……</p>
			<p>Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong finished dealing with White Feather King, Old Man Fortune, and remnants of Universe First Race, and made his way back to the Blazing Dragon Universe. That night, inside the World of Departed Souls’ grandest palace, spring was blossoming where Huang Xiaolong showed the might worthy of a Universe God, and to attest to that were the endless screams and pleadings of several women…. </p>
